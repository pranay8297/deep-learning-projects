I like being able to turn lights on and off while away from home.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t31-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"I have had a lot of fun with this thing. My 4 yr old learns about dinosaurs, i control the lights and play games like categories.

Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait to see what else it can do.\"\\t1\\r\\n3\\t31-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t31-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI think this is the 5th one I\\'ve purchased. I\\'m working on getting one in every room of my house.

Great speaker and easy to set up.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tWe have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tWe love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it\\'s just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what\\'s not to like? :)\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tLove the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We\\'re sure we\\'ll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it\\'s a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn\\'t understand what we\\'re saying.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\t\"Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not intrusive to look at.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI love it. It plays my sleep sounds immediately when I ask\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"I got a second unit for the bedroom, I was expecting the sounds to be improved but I didnt really see a difference at all.  Overall, not a big improvement over the 1st generation.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\tAmazing product\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"I love my Echo. It\\'s easy to operate, loads of fun.It is everything as advertised.

Love them!\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask, but I think it will be better.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tJust like the other one\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\tStill learning all the capabilities...but so far pretty pretty pretty good\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI like it\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"She works well. Needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. Alexa \\xe2\\x80\\x9clearn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Tasha\\xe2\\x80\\x99s birthday.  Or Alexa \\xe2\\x80\\x9clearn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d my definition of Fine. Etc. other than that she is great\"\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tThe speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I\\'ve done it correctly but they won\\'t sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tThis device is awesome!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"Love my Echo. Still learning all the things it will do. Wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t able to follow instructions included in the package, but found a great one on U-Tube.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tSpeaker is better than 1st generation Echo\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"This thing is way cool!  You should get one.  If you want to be cool, that is.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\t\"This is my first digital assistant so I\\'m giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That\\'s what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven\\'t had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. My purchase came with a Smart Plug for $10 which I connect my lamp to. Alexa, turn of the lights!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tMy husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  I wish we knew all it\\'s capabilities\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"My Android would not allow Alexa to connect. Fortunately, my sister was here with her Apple cell. After an hour+ tech support fixed the glitches. We are up and running.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tSo far so good\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tTried to play certain broadway shows like Camelot and it gives ne the group Camelot.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\tGreat\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWalnut Finish \\tVery satisfied with the Echo. Alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to Jimmy Buffet by just asking Alexa.\\t1\\r\\n2\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"It\\'s like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa.  I don\\'t see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tLove my Echo.

To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify \\xe2\\x80\\x9cplus/prime/etc\\xe2\\x80\\x9d account.  So you must pay to play \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyour\\xe2\\x80\\x9d music.  3 stars for that reason.

It works well. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many \\xe2\\x80\\x9capps\\xe2\\x80\\x9d you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tThe speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI LIKE IT ALL\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI love it.

I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It\\'s fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I\\'ve been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tLove it - am using it strictly for music now and it\\'s great!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"Love the Echo !!!

I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn\\'t rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue. Overall, great product.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"Works great, upgraded from echo dot to full size echo, couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be happier!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tIt\\'s Alexa.... what else can you say\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tUpgraded from my lilttle echo dot.

Speaker sounds good with my Spotify blasting through it.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tHaving so much fun with Alexa. Love being able to listen to music when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m across the room or busy doing something else.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"So far it seems to be a very nice item. It picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. The other day I asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. I\\'ve only used it to listen to music and check the weather, but it has done both of those things very well.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tLove our echo\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"I love it,she is very helpful. I use her for remembering things and sleep. You can ask her just about anything. I have only had her for about a week so still learning her.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"It\\'s better than the 1st gen in every way except for one.  I really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  It was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &#34;-&#34; one and press it a few times.  I also wish the bass was a bit better.  All in all, it\\'s a great device and I\\'m happy with it.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI love having an Alexa!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tSo far I like it \\xf0\\x9f\\xa4\\x93\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tI am thoroughly enjoying my Ecoo!  Love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then I can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere. Wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book. Great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tStill love it\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tLove it\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\t\"I love the sound quality of this unit, it is a very clear sound.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\tI just this for listening to talk radio in the morning and turning lights on and off etc. The system does an excellent job as a full house sound system streaming Sirius.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"I have had for only a week, so I am still learning all that Alexa can do.  It is a learning process.  I love the music I can call up any time.  I listen to podcasts and radio stations.  I have just started keeping shopping lists and grocery lists, which I love.  I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to search for paper and pencil.  Getting time and temperature are great, do not have to wait for weather reports.  The sound is good.  I am not fussy about woofers, tweeters, base , etc.  the Echo is fine for me.  This afternoon I am going to try \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdropping in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.on my son when he gets home.  Going to surprise him.\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tNot much features.\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"Great sound quality, great features, great product. Multi room music is very cool.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tCool\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tEveryone should have an Echo or two or three or more. I bought my Echo through QVC.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\tit\\'s annoying that everything they show Alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. You spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI have had Alexa since the beginning.  I accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation.  I decided I couldn\\'t be without an Echo.  Setup was easy and had it working within minutes.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"I like being able to tell Alexia the music I want to hear, but sometimes she has trouble finding the song if I am not very specific about the title.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tI like the looks better than the original echo.  I moved my old echo to the basement family room. Nice sound.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tThe Echo is wonderful but I\\'m still learning how to use it. Music requests are somewhat limited.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\t\"Doesn\\'t know half the things asked. Can\\'t recognize my sprinkler wifi controller, even though product details says it is compatible. Can\\'t program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same wifi router. Just a handy music player. That\\'s if you have Amazon Music.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\tLove it\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\tawesome.understands my kids\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tWe were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features. How nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command. Looking forward to exploring other options with this device.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tMet and exceeded my expectations. Easy set up and is really quick in responses.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"I like the fact that I can get any kind of music from Prime that I want on request from Alexa. I liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your TV etc. to the commands from Alexa. BUT, I really love having the music.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  I think it should be part of the top line with video, music, etc.  I also think the setup app where i define, for example music i like, is not well integrated into echo.  I have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings.  I also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names, which i can never remember.I like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tThis is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better. Thank you!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"During Prime Day this 2nd gen Echo was on sale so I couldn\\'t resist! This was the beginning to my smart home set up and I couldn\\'t be happier to say that Alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my \"\"smart\"\" devices. Thanks to her, I can control my lights, smart plugs, TV, etc. I had no trouble connecting the Echo to my WiFi and my phone. The app works perfectly fine and it let\\'s you add skills, routines, smart devices, timers, and so much more! Sound quality is good enough for me, since I am not an audiophile. Alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume. Design is great and modern, it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you\\'d like as there are more for sale. Overall, this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities. If you haven\\'t yet, be sure to add Alexa to your home!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tOak Finish \\tVersatile and fun !!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tWorks great! Killer speaker!

I never would have bought one for myself, but now that I have it.... Allows me to play music on it from my amozon prime music ; that\\'s worth it in and of itself.  Also, gives new\\'s briefs and tells jokes.\"\\t1\\r\\n3\\t29-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\t \\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"My mom bought a few Echo Dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great.

It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small Echo Dot, that I will be returning to her. I say if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to order an Alexa speaker, go big and get the Echo, otherwise tou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll Be returning the two Echo Dots you couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t live without.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tLove it!! Great product!!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tEasy set up very user friendly\\t1\\r\\n2\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"Really disappointed Alexa has to be plug-in to wall socket all the time.  My fault for not checking this, but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as Amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery.  If I could return it, I would as my Apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the Alexa.\"\\t0\\r\\n3\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI don\\'t think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn\\'t you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn\\'t unique to this unit but I don\\'t understand why I can\\'t override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tEverything\\t1\\r\\n3\\t29-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tI like the interaction of asking questions.

Definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI really love my amazon echo. I think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it. It is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tLove it!  So do the grandkids!!\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\t\"So far it has worked well.

Speaker quality is great and over all we love our Alexa. My only two ( not complaints, more suggestions for the future series) would be better communication ability. Example: For our smart lights in the house. Unless we specify kitchen Light 1 or kitchen Light 2 prior to the command she either won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t respond or says she doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recognize. It may be me, but I want my Alexa to respond when I say thank you afterwards. I have to repeat Alexa thank you and there are times she won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t respond to me, but will my husband. I know it sounds odd. We laugh about it, but maybe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a Southern thing but I want my Alexa to have manners too.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"Like everything about it. The music, the trivia games, the weather.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tAs described and received on time.

But the sound from the echo is superb. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll keep it..\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tLove this!  Have it in the kitchen and works well!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tVery nice!

There isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t anything I dislike.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tWe\\'re thoroughly enjoying our Amazon Echo. Installation was easy using the Alexa app. I purchased 2 Kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights. Installation again was easy using the Kasa app. They sinqued right up with the Echo.

Bought it from the &#34;warehouse&#34; or &#34;outlet&#34; with a &#34;minor imperfection. Can\\'t tell it even has one. works great. Didn\\'t come in packaging, but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasn\\'t missing anything. I like the sound quality, I see some knock it. It\\'s not a BOSE but it\\'s more than great for our family. Easy to use, minor learning curve as it learns your voice. It integrates seamlessly with my other amazon services.Can\\'t wait to get for my classroom too! It\\'s a lot of fun even just as a speaker, let alone what I plan to do with it.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"I love my Echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it\\'s wonderful!, music, info, sleeping sounds!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"Awesome life changer! Seriously, I am able to start my morning with Alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. She has gotten used to my voice, that I can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what I say. I love both my echos!!! Don\\'t hesitate, get one and for the price, the speaker is unbelievable. I am buying the cordless holder, so I can take the echo anywhere. Love my purchase and love alexa!!!!\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Prime lapsed, she wouldn\\'t play anything. She isn\\'t smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can\\'t use it for that either. She randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her. Just today I unplugged her...not sure I\\'ll ever use my Alexa again.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI like everything about it !!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tLiked 100%\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tNever had ANY issue with buying use electronics as long as I get the GOOD or LIKE NEW.

Worth every penny. It\\'s like having 3 household employees for a small flat rate. We keep them in the bedrooms and the living room. We can drop-in and use them as an intercom, listen to music, answer quick questions, alarms to wake up for school, etc.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tListen music and set timer\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\tI received the echo in perfect condition. The device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues. Alexa is a great addition to our family!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tGood sound. Like it for music and scheduling. Like that i can get random thoughts recorded while I think about them. The jokes are cute!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tPurchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do.  So far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform.  Am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"This echo is just as great as my others, even though it is smaller.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tFunny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  Loving it!!\\t1\\r\\n3\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"I bought this to replace a &#34;Dot&#34; in my living room. Speaker is slightly better. It hears me better over the TV. Unfortunately, it doesn\\'t understand or respond to my requests as well as the Dot. I frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what I want. The Dot usually does exactly what I want on the first request. I don\\'t consider it an upgrade.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"I have had all good experience, so far with the second generation Echo. There are so many more things to learn, but I have not had the time yet. Right now, I am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. I have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. I am very excited to begin using them\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m having trouble connecting my tv to it, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not exactly tech smart. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me. So far I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using it mostly for music.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tSimply love my Echo. I hardly watch any TV at all anymore. I\\'m too busy listening to music. Speaker is pretty goo for its size. All the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tEnjoyed entire echo experience\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tEasy to set up.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn\\'t.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can\\'t make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tWe are loving Ours very much\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\t\"I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best. I\\'m happy to see they are making improvements with each new one.It would be great to have updates to our little A.I.\\'s, I think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it. All in all I am very happy with her and I can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble. Thank you\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"Very pleased with the Echo 2nd Generation. It is so nice to have Alexa available for music, weather, news, and probably a lot more we haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t discovered.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\t\"I am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the Echo. If you are a big fan of deep bass, this might not be sufficient for you though. The potential to control your home is an option I will explore more as I evolve my home into a \"\"smart home\"\". The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo. I am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when I ask it to tell me a joke. It tells me where my packages are since I am an amazon prime addict, it comes in extremely  handy!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tEasy to setup.

Wow, were we amazed and the great sound!  We\\'ve also been having a great time listening to all of our favorite songs buy just asking Alexa.  I may even buy one for my elderly Dad - I think he will enjoy having one to listen to music or even place his calls to us!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"I really have enjoyed it.  Changing the Directv channels, plays iHeartRadio and Pandora , adjusts the ac thermostat and turns the living room lights and outside lights.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI have been wanting one of these for a while now.  Bought on Prime Day and absolutely love it.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tWe are so glad that we got the Echo over a Bluetooth speaker. Alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there. I personally love the timer feature. It has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously.

I will get the Echo hub and a few more Echo dots in the future.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tSee subject line.

The echo is the same except the sound quality, which I really didn\\'t feel I needed. However, I am so glad I got it. What a difference! The sound really is far superior to the Echo Dot! Now I can listen to The Greatest Showman with a little more power!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\tSound quality is great. Still learning about all the different things I can do with it. FUN!!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tGot a good deal and works great with Prime.

She loves it!!  I especially like the calling feature since she doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a cell phone.

If it had better built in speaker\\'s, would definitively be a 5 star. They thought ahead and put  an audio auxiliary input, so I bought a dedicated speaker for the Echo.

My wife and i both are native Americans whose language is English she is from the north i am from Texas  neither have an accent from our birth area and yet it does not do a good job understanding us.  We bought two they do the same thing.  Additionally wifi reception was poor to marginal. I had to buy Wifi range extender for office and the other is ten feet from our router.  Both had problems Switched them around no difference.  So it they are now disconnected dust collectors.\\t0\\r\\n5\\t12-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tThis is my third Dot. They all work perfectly and I use each one multiple times a day. Absolutely love them.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t12-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tItem has never worked. Out of box it is broken. Spent several days trying to get it working and running same &#34;fixes&#34; from Amazon. The only thing accomplished is I will never order another refurbished device.\\t0\\r\\n5\\t11-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tI already have the echo plus.  Bought this one for my bedroom.  Love the functions.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t11-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tSimple set up.  Music everywhere.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t11-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tWorked just like a brand new Dot ---so I am very satisfied.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t11-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tGreat product but returning for new Alexa Dot.  Refurbished is already giving me problems with connection.\\t0\\r\\n5\\t10-Jul-18\\tWhite\\tWe have a few echos already. Went for this one in refurbished to save a few bucks. It works great. I love this new generation one because it has a rubber bottom - nice.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t10-Jul-18\\tBlack\\t\"I love the fact, that I can unplug it, and take it to my basement when I want do laundry.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t10-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tRefurbished but just as good as the new ones that I\\'ve bought.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t9-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tGood as new\\t1\\r\\n5\\t9-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tGranddaughter loves it\\t1\\r\\n4\\t9-Jul-18\\tBlack\\t\"The price is great.  Was having trouble with it hearing me from across a room, but after moving it to another spot, it seems to be working fine.  Will buy some more. Want 1 in every room.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t9-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tWe have set up alexa to blue tooth speakers and enjoy listening to music outdoors.  Can\\'t wait to try more new stuff using Alexa!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t9-Jul-18\\tWhite\\tThanks\\t1\\r\\n5\\t9-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tWorks great!\\t1\\r\\n1\\t9-Jul-18\\tBlack\\t\"&#34;NEVER BUY CERTIFIED AND REFURBISHED ECHO DOT &#34; I bought a &#34;Certified and Refurbished &#34; Echo Dot. This unit is very poor in receiving command and sometimes it does not even acknowledge the command. Never buy a refurbished Echo dot. The unit I received was probably never was certified and refurbished as indicated. I also bought a new ECHO dot, it works perfectly.Very disappointed !!!!\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t8-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tStarted here with Amazon productsAnd I regret nothing is been absolutely great journey and my products continue to improve my day-to-day life\\t1\\r\\n5\\t8-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tHave now used for several months without problem.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t7-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tThis is my first smart device and I will surely be buying other devices that will be compatible with this one.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t7-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tLove\\t1\\r\\n5\\t7-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tLove it just as good as a new one\\t1\\r\\n5\\t7-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tHave had an larger echo for some time and love it. Bought this one for another portion of the house since we have several wifi home devices and we wanted to voice control them from all over the house.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t7-Jul-18\\tWhite\\tLove the product.  Use to turn on my lights and answer some quick questions.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t7-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tA great buy\\t1\\r\\n5\\t6-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tWas Leary about refurbished but work great.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t5-Jul-18\\tWhite\\t\"Very puny sound, but works great.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t5-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tGreat\\t1\\r\\n5\\t5-Jul-18\\tBlack\\t\"Exactly like new, can tell the difference from my new dot I got prior to this one, works perfectly.

Finally Amazon enables the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdrop-in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d feature so now I can use my Echos to reach out to family in remote parts of the house (and teenagers who insist they never heard me yelling at them to come down to dinner).As for its other features, we mainly use our Echos for the standard stuff: playing music, setting alarms, answering questions, etc. It\\'s not the life-changing home device Amazon would have you believe, but it is convenient to have around. This refurb saved me a few bucks, looks and works the same as the other brand-new ones.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t3-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tLove it was worried about the refurbished part at first but this being my first echo. It is awesome have used it for everything my lights since I work nights and shopping as well as for my spotify. And planning on getting it for my parents to help them out for everyday things we take for granted when we are young... I would recommend this to everyone!!!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t3-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tLove Alexa hope have her in every room soon.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t3-Jul-18\\tWhite\\tThe simplicity of use and setting up.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t2-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tThis is great!

It can answer a variety of questions. I would like if the volume could go just a little bit louder, but I can\\'t complain.I also believe it should have an internal power source. In order to use the Echo, it must be plugged in at all times using the universal charging cord. It would be nice to use the Echo Dot on the go without having to buy the other product.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t2-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tLove it!  Great fun!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t2-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tLove it!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t2-Jul-18\\tWhite\\toutstanding I use all the time....works just like they say\\t1\\r\\n5\\t2-Jul-18\\tWhite\\t\"saving $10 is always nice and my son always says that buying refurbished means your are getting a new device or product for less, because it has been run through a diagnostics again and everything has been corrected.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t1-Jul-18\\tBlack\\t\"Works perfectly, Alexa turns on and off my lights, my tv, roomba!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t1-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tNever would know it was refurbished.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t1-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tSo far so good\\t1\\r\\n5\\t1-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tLooks and performs as new.

Certified refurbished should mean it works as advertised. Instead this item crashed as soon as I turned it on and plugged it in. When trying to connect from my phone to the echo dot, it crashed, over and over. Not only would it disconnect but the orange light would freeze and then the thing would reboot with the blue light. Alexa would tell me it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ready to connect and freeze mid sentence. Tried holding the action button for 5 seconds and it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything. Returning immediately and hope they actually fix this item when the next buyer purchases it.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"Very fast service,  got what I ordered. Thank you\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tLove it even though I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still trying to figure out all the other things I can do with this item it works great with my phone.\\t1\\r\\n2\\t29-Jun-18\\tWhite\\tNone\\t0\\r\\n5\\t29-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"I have 2 Echos, one I bought brand new and the other is a refurbished one.Honestly, I can\\'t tell the difference in performance and looks.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tA GREAT PRODUCT...once we learned how to work it...this thing is awesome!!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tIt works\\t1\\r\\n1\\t28-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tDoes not work all the time\\t0\\r\\n4\\t27-Jun-18\\tWhite\\t\"Love it. Though, wish it was portable.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tof course!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tYou could not tell this was refurbished. Works Excellent. I would highly recommended instead of purchasing new.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tI got this for my mom . She loves it !\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tI love my echo dot! Looks brand new and works perfect! Very satisfied.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tSame as new\\t1\\r\\n4\\t27-Jun-18\\tWhite\\t\"A small problem out of the box, but a rep from Amazon called and walked me through a reset process which solved my issues. I was shocked to get a response so quickly and a real effort was made (including follow up email) to get this thing working. I have 6 now (and one google clone) and the more I use it, and learn about it, the more I like it (them). I also plan to install one in my car, boat and garage. Alexa is my new best friend!?!? (lol)I think GF is worried that if Alexa learns to cook, her time will be limited...\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t27-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"I love my Alexa Dot. I play games with my son, ask how the weather Is and I love that she works with my Amazon Fire Tv.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tI like it because you could ask it different questions and it does different things it works intermittently with my smart TV if I ask you to change the volume it does or does it sometimes if I ask you to change the channel it does or doesn\\'t sometimes I have to reset it I don\\'t know if it\\'s because it\\'s refurbished but it\\'s okay it\\'s just not what I expected\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"So far the certified refurbished Echo Dot works well. It was a little confusing to have a green ring on the Echo Dot and not 100% know why it was there. Asked Alexa and she said it was because of a receiving a call or drop in. But that was not the case. Took about 10 minutes to figure out it was a notification that I had a delivery from amazon. I believe the ring is supposed to be yellow and pulsate for a message notification, but on my refurbished Echo Dot it was Green and pulsed.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tIt arrived quickly and was easy to set up ! it was a refurbished amazon echo dot it was above and beyond what I expected ! Alexa and I have become buddies she is a great assistant\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"Works as advertised. Speak clearly, and research the commands. Also. Get the wall holder, it keeps it out of the way. Set up is a breeze, just make sure you are close to the device initially when connecting your phone. For some reason it made set up easier...though it could be psychological haha\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t26-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tLove my two echo dots but the third one we ordered to give as a gift had a defective speaker.  The return process still isn\\'t done and has already taken weeks.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t26-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tI\\'ve already returned it.\\t0\\r\\n5\\t25-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"The refurbished echo for has been wonderful. I purchased this for my mother. She loves the ability to contact me without a phone, listen to music, weather, and ask questions. It\\'s been a wonderful gift and works excellently with no problems\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t25-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"Works good. However, the price went down the week after I purchased it.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t25-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tWorks amazingly. I bought it for my daughter and she loves it.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t25-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"I love Alexa! It\\'s great helping me, making my appointments, playing the songs I like! What else can you do?

We showering.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t25-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tI have 3-Dots and 2-Original and this new one works perfectly.  Will buy all my future Dots reconditioned.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t25-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tWas a little hard to get it to pare up with the others but once it did no problems at all\\t1\\r\\n1\\t25-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"Now I\\'m weary about these picking up conversations when you are not actively using them - heard about this happening on the news.  I have 3-4, so this is very concerning.  I wish Amazon would release something widespread  or push some firmware to prevent this.  If they have, I have not heard about it yet.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t24-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tThere\\'s really no dislike for Alexa( dot) I thought cortna was cool but Alexa is an awesome application to the family. Unbelievable device which seems alive. A must get.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t24-Jun-18\\tWhite\\t\"I am happy with the refurbished echo dot. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had it for about two weeks, and so far it is working perfectly! Even though it did not come in its original box, it looks like new! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m happy with this purchase!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t24-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tThumbs up!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t24-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tWorkreat\\t1\\r\\n1\\t24-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"There was something wrong with the first one that no even the rep I spoke with could fix. The replacement was registered to someone else. When the price of the Dot went down to $39.99 (same price as the refurbished ones), I bought a brand, spanking new one. No problem with the new one.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t24-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tWorks as expected!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t23-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tNo problems\\t1\\r\\n5\\t23-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tHave these in almost every room.

No issues with the refurbished as they are like new.\"\\t1\\r\\n3\\t21-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"Started taking on her own! Haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t used it since I unplugged it that day. No one was talking, my daughter was laying in bed next to be and she just started going on about the movie Moana and completely scared the sh*t out of my daughter now.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tIt works great the speaker sounds fine and overall would recommend\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tGreat! Just like new!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"Loved the price for an essentially brand new Dot!! Opening it, you really couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell that it was refurbished. Everything looked brand new. For $20 less than a new unit, I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t consider this a better deal! I really love the versatility of the echo dot.

It is useless.\"\\t0\\r\\n4\\t19-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"Works very well, but the microphone don&#34;t pick up as well as the full size echo.

I own an echo 2nd gen for the kitchen/living room and got this for my bedroom, but there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a SIGNIFICANT difference in sound. The dot lacks a full base sound and sounds as if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming off a cheap portable speaker. I was REALLY disappointed. I returned it right away and just shelled out the money to buy a second echo 2 for my bedroom also.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t14-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"Took me awhile to get it connected.

I would have assumed an amazon product sold on amazon would have had higher standards than guaranteeing that it would work for 3 whole months. I mean what is this product supposed to be, a piece of junk?They offered my a 15% discount if I wanted to buy another one. Why would I want to buy another one?\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t12-Jun-18\\tWhite\\t\"Just like new. No problems whatsoever, Alexa. Thank you.\"\\t1\\r\\n3\\t12-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tI like my uncle. But sometime it goes a little Haywire\\t1\\r\\n1\\t12-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tBought this for my son and it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work. He had to return it.\\t0\\r\\n1\\t12-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tBought 2 and both quit connecting to wifi and responding to voice within 9 months. Hard and soft reset will not fix the problem.\\t0\\r\\n3\\t12-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"I received my Echo Dot today in good condition, but be advised: I paid $29.99 for it and Amazon has (as of this writing) raised the price to $39.99, so do your research before buying so you can get a good deal!Set up with the Dot went simple enough \\xe2\\x80\\x94 plug it in, follow the app instructions... except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iPhone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s WiFi settings. I called Amazon customer service, and I dunno what it is, but lately I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been getting terrible support. The guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and I ended up setting up the Dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure if this is the norm or if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because this is refurbished, but the Dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5GHz connection is strong. Reconnecting is a pain each time as well.All that said, when Alexa works, she works amazingly well. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing I really enjoy is the mic\\xe2\\x80\\x99s range and sensitivity. One of the more annoying limitations of Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Siri is that when she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHey Siri\\xe2\\x80\\x9d feature is all but useless. Alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tried this with louder speakers yet, so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure if this will continue to hold true.Setting up Alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations \\xe2\\x80\\x94 support for Arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your LED devices (eg. rainbow effects), Alexa can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.All in all, my rating would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been lower had I not gotten a decent price on this item. If the connectivity problems persist, I may have to exchange/return this item. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to though \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Alexa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kind of growing on me.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t11-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tI bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs. But I have no need for it. I only used it once. The volume was not loud enough for me when I played music while I was on my treadmill. So I rather use my tower speaker which is 3xs louder.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t11-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tWorked like new.  Will do it again.\\t1\\r\\n2\\t11-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tThe second one which was a refurbished model did work-at least not in my home.\\t0\\r\\n1\\t11-Jun-18\\tWhite\\t\"Very bad this device, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because is refurbished or what but it activated by itself , nobody is talking and he just activated and start talking.

Get one!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t11-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tAdding more rooms for convenience\\t1\\r\\n4\\t11-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"Nice. It works good.Some times is not easy to recognize your voice and you have to repeat several times, some time almost screaming.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t11-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"I took a chance on a certified refurbished unit for $29. Looks brand new...no excuses or disappointments. 5 minute trouble-free set up! Effortless bluetooth speaker connectivity through the Alexa App on my iPhone was flawless. Listening to my favorite tunes through a Bose Bluetooth setup and couldn\\'t be happier. Walk through the door and just ask Alexa to: &#34;Play 80\\'s music&#34; and viola... instant atmosphere! No more opening the iPad, going to settings, turning on bluetooth and then accessing the Pandora app. It just makes things so effortless. A true joy right out of the box! If I didn\\'t discover any other uses for this fine piece of technology it was worth every penny!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t11-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tAlexa\\'s sister (my second dot)\\t1\\r\\n5\\t11-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"Love my Alexa Echo Dot - I have two of them now - one new, one refurbished.

Who knew it would be here so soon?\\t1\\r\\n4\\t7-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"Works great to control the TV lights and various other devices. Lately I\\'ve been using it when i wake up and don\\'t know what time it is but don\\'t want to open my eyes. Just shout out &#34;Alexa, What time is it?&#34; if i could just figure out how to get it to do house hold chores and walk the dogs it\\'d be golden! sound is not that great but with its size what can you expect. The Echo Plus has much better audio but that is what you get with the larger more expensive Echo.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t7-Jun-18\\tWhite\\tWorks great!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t7-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tWasn\\'t sure if I\\'d like this product but after having it for a little while I want one in every room!

Glad I did, and will probably buy another refurb product form Amazon. I love the Alexa products and have several. This one sits on my desk. Has a small footprint, but has great sound and I use it daily. Works great.\"\\t1\\r\\n3\\t5-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tNot bad bad speaker for sound\\t1\\r\\n4\\t5-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"This is a great device. We mainly use it to verbally add things to the shopping list, but occasionally use any number of the &#34;fun&#34; things you can program it to do, like go to Red Alert or make the TARDIS land (yes, we\\'re a house of geeks... we even chose the wake-word to be &#34;Computer&#34; instead of &#34;Alexa&#34;. Now we just need Majel Barret\\'s voice and I will be in geek heaven.) ;)It\\'s not as easy to get my Premium Spotify to work properly with it, and still not sure how we can get multiple music accounts attached so we can listen to different music in different rooms, but so far it\\'s still been worth it. I am often asking it the time, the weather, it even gives us a news briefing. We also use it as an intercom system which has been really awesome. Plus it\\'s fun knowing the NSA is listening to everything.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t5-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tWe all love her!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t5-Jun-18\\tWhite\\tI purchased this for my daughter and we all love this!!!! its amazing!! we love the games!\\t1\\r\\n2\\t5-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tIt doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always  work\\t0\\r\\n5\\t5-Jun-18\\tWhite\\tGood as new!

My daughter have me it.  It reads to me!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t3-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"Refurbish Echo Dot received as new condition, as new packaging, no complaints. Neat little gadget.(Drives my wife nuts!)\"\\t1\\r\\n3\\t3-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"I received an Echo as a gift, loved it so much I decided to get the Dot for my bedroom. Both very easy to set up but a big difference in the sound quality. I would still buy it again.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t3-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tWorked as advertised. Thanks\\t1\\r\\n1\\t3-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tAll the new Amazon products I have are great everything I bought refurbished is complete garbage.

Microphone is not as good as the better Echo products\\t1\\r\\n5\\t2-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tTook a little work to set up but I finally got it.  Sound quality not the best but for what I got it for it works great.  I check weather and ask a few cooking questions in the kitchen with it.  I do play the radio on it when I want some music but will probably upgrade to the Echo plus for better sound.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t1-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tLove Alexa these are the best thing I have ever bought don\\'t know how I ever lived with out these things amazing so happy with this product just wish it would use google to\\t1\\r\\n5\\t1-Jun-18\\tWhite\\tI loved it it works great\\t1\\r\\n1\\t31-May-18\\tWhite\\tExtremely low in volume\\t0\\r\\n4\\t31-May-18\\tBlack\\t\"I had some trouble getting the program downloaded from my phone. I ended up using my computer. It is interesting that the answers come from Wikipedia. However, I will give Echo dot an &#34;A&#34; in the music playing department. I heard songs and music totally forgotten on the mainstream stations. Also amusing when Alexa responds, I don\\'t know that. Why does she think the yards of cotton fabric refer to football playing???? If I had paid full price for this gadget I would have been sorely disappointed. Now it seems reasonable and a step above HAL.\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t31-May-18\\tWhite\\t\"Brought to replace one that I moved and doesn\\'t have the same range as my previous (non refurbished) unit. It would seldom be able to find the Wi-Fi and couldn\\'t connect. Got tired of hearing the message (&#34;trouble connecting...check the Alexa app...&#34;) and just unplugged it. I went through the troubleshooting and reconnected it several times, it\\'s just not as strong.\"\\t0\\r\\n1\\t31-May-18\\tBlack\\t\"If you want to listen to music and have it come through several of the Echo/Dot units simultaneously, YOU MUST PAY A MONTHLY FEE. I thought this was Amazon, not Apple??!! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve paid for many of these so I could have one in each room, is that not enough of my money??!!??\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t31-May-18\\tBlack\\t\"Purchased as a gift,\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t31-May-18\\tBlack\\tLove it\\t1\\r\\n4\\t31-May-18\\tBlack\\t\"Overall good device. It was bought for a workout room, and has issues reaching a volume that can be heard over a standard row machine. It could use a much better speaker.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t31-May-18\\tWhite\\tWorks great and simple to set up. Alexa is way more accurate than I imagined so Im using it more than I thought. Wish alarms could be set a bit further out but thats my only complaint.No she\\'s not listening when you don\\'t say the wake word so if you\\'re worried you can lose the conspiracy theories. The speaker is great too so don\\'t hold off on getting one if you were turned off by gen 1 like me.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t31-May-18\\tBlack\\tThe voice clarity has made my eavesdropping efforts so much easier - the government. :)\\t1\\r\\n5\\t31-May-18\\tWhite\\tWorked perfect\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-May-18\\tWhite\\t\"Had a little trouble at the beginning until I replaced my old router and it works good except for current temperature and at times Alexa will be off by as much as 10 degrees!  Like when it was 91 degrees, Alexa would say it was 81 degrees.  Otherwise, everything works as expected and enjoy listening to music from Amazon and my Pandora stations and requesting my favorite song or recording artist.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-May-18\\tBlack\\tI bought three of these and all three have worked flawlessly. If they weren\\'t labeled as refurbished I wouldn\\'t have known\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-May-18\\tBlack\\t\"This device works perfectly and was a good price.  We love Alexa and are having great fun with her.  The music is great and we get the radio stations we need for our morning traffic report.  I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I would enjoy having AI in the house, but it is fun, educational and entertaining even for people who aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tech savvy.\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-May-18\\tWhite\\tEh. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s works on and off. Half the time it does not respond when you say wake up name. Other then that works fine\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-May-18\\tWhite\\tGreat little thing.

I think I prefer the volume ring of the first gen better than the buttons on the second gen, but still more than does the job and great for the price I got it for.  I\\'d still definitely recommend.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-May-18\\tBlack\\tVery fun to use and having morning briefing\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-May-18\\tBlack\\tArrived on time and works amazing!!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-May-18\\tWhite\\t\"Just like new, set-up was quick & easy.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-May-18\\tBlack\\t\"like new, good refurbishing\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-May-18\\tBlack\\tLove it\\t1\\r\\n4\\t27-May-18\\tBlack\\tLove my echo dot!!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-May-18\\tBlack\\tI like that it knows my music type.The least is that it isn\\'t wireless and the volume is not that high.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-May-18\\tWhite\\tgreat product!\\t1\\r\\n3\\t27-May-18\\tBlack\\t\"It works great, but the reason I\\'m leaving 3 stars is because it wont play unless it plugged in the whole time. Pretty irritating especially when there is no outlet available.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-May-18\\tWhite\\tWorks great!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-May-18\\tBlack\\tI love it ita like having a personal assistant and computer and everything else in one.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-May-18\\tBlack\\t\"The problem I have with this item could just be my inexperience. I ordered the wrong thing, but then decided I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d set it up and use Alexa. I was trying to replace a small Bluetooth speaker in my bedroom. Thought I could learn as I go. I downloaded the app, but never could get the Echo to sync with my iPhone. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve decided to give this to one of my kids and they will probably enjoy it and use it as it is intended.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-May-18\\tBlack\\tEs perfecto.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-May-18\\tBlack\\tWorking good so far.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-May-18\\tBlack\\tWorking great and my daughter loves it!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-May-18\\tBlack\\tWorks great\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-May-18\\tWhite\\tI love it\\t1\\r\\n1\\t26-May-18\\tWhite\\t\"I wanted a white dot for my white bathroom.

Refurbished unit did not even turn on and after a while I realized that the power adapter was faulty. There is no way for me to have Amazon send me a power adapter by itself according to the return options. I love Amazon and buy even my toilet paper through them but this was truly a let down.Update: Amazon contacted me and credited me enough to buy a new power adapter. This is why I shop on Amazon. I can always trust them to deliver on their products.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t19-May-18\\tBlack\\tI bought this for a family member as a gift.

We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists.

We\\'re sure we\\'ll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it\\'s a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn\\'t understand what we\\'re saying.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\t\"Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music.

I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I\\'ve done it correctly but they won\\'t sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tThis device is awesome!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"Love my Echo.

Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That\\'s what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven\\'t had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with.

Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many \\xe2\\x80\\x9capps\\xe2\\x80\\x9d you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components.

I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It\\'s fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I\\'ve been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tLove it - am using it strictly for music now and it\\'s great!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"Love the Echo !!!

I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn\\'t rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue.

It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small Echo Dot, that I will be returning to her.

My fault for not checking this, but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as Amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery.  If I could return it, I would as my Apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the Alexa.\"\\t0\\r\\n3\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI don\\'t think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn\\'t you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn\\'t unique to this unit but I don\\'t understand why I can\\'t override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.

Speaker quality is great and over all we love our Alexa. My only two ( not complaints, more suggestions for the future series) would be better communication ability. Example: For our smart lights in the house. Unless we specify kitchen Light 1 or kitchen Light 2 prior to the command she either won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t respond or says she doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recognize. It may be me, but I want my Alexa to respond when I say thank you afterwards. I have to repeat Alexa thank you and there are times she won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t respond to me, but will my husband. I know it sounds odd. We laugh about it, but maybe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a Southern thing but I want my Alexa to have manners too.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"Like everything about it.

Bought it from the &#34;warehouse&#34; or &#34;outlet&#34; with a &#34;minor imperfection. Can\\'t tell it even has one. works great. Didn\\'t come in packaging, but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasn\\'t missing anything. I like the sound quality, I see some knock it. It\\'s not a BOSE but it\\'s more than great for our family. Easy to use, minor learning curve as it learns your voice. It integrates seamlessly with my other amazon services.Can\\'t wait to get for my classroom too! It\\'s a lot of fun even just as a speaker, let alone what I plan to do with it.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"I love my Echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it\\'s wonderful!, music, info, sleeping sounds!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"Awesome life changer! Seriously, I am able to start my morning with Alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. She has gotten used to my voice, that I can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what I say. I love both my echos!!! Don\\'t hesitate, get one and for the price, the speaker is unbelievable. I am buying the cordless holder, so I can take the echo anywhere. Love my purchase and love alexa!!!!\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Prime lapsed, she wouldn\\'t play anything. She isn\\'t smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can\\'t use it for that either. She randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her.

Worth every penny. It\\'s like having 3 household employees for a small flat rate. We keep them in the bedrooms and the living room. We can drop-in and use them as an intercom, listen to music, answer quick questions, alarms to wake up for school, etc.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tListen music and set timer\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\tI received the echo in perfect condition. The device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues. Alexa is a great addition to our family!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tGood sound.

The jokes are cute!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tPurchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do.  So far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform.  Am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"This echo is just as great as my others, even though it is smaller.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tFunny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  Loving it!!\\t1\\r\\n3\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"I bought this to replace a &#34;Dot&#34; in my living room. Speaker is slightly better. It hears me better over the TV. Unfortunately, it doesn\\'t understand or respond to my requests as well as the Dot. I frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what I want. The Dot usually does exactly what I want on the first request. I don\\'t consider it an upgrade.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"I have had all good experience, so far with the second generation Echo. There are so many more things to learn, but I have not had the time yet. Right now, I am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. I have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. I am very excited to begin using them\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m having trouble connecting my tv to it, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not exactly tech smart. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me. So far I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using it mostly for music.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tSimply love my Echo. I hardly watch any TV at all anymore. I\\'m too busy listening to music. Speaker is pretty goo for its size. All the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tEnjoyed entire echo experience\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tEasy to set up.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn\\'t.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can\\'t make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tWe are loving Ours very much\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\t\"I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best.

If you are a big fan of deep bass, this might not be sufficient for you though. The potential to control your home is an option I will explore more as I evolve my home into a \"\"smart home\"\". The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo. I am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when I ask it to tell me a joke. It tells me where my packages are since I am an amazon prime addict, it comes in extremely  handy!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tEasy to setup.

However, for the price it should come with the stand\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I love this device! All the functionality of an Amazon Echo with the added benefit of a video screen. It looks great on my nightstand as a clock (lots of faces to choose from) and displays weather, reminders, etc. I think it can do video calls too but I use FaceTime for that anyway. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great shape and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take up a lot of room. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m planning to get another one for my guest room. Awesome for a great price!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI love the Echo Spot. This bedside alarm clock size device can do what theEcho Show can do. I was concerned because I already had a large Echo in mybedroom that answered to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlexa\\xe2\\x80\\x9d like the other devices in my home. I wasconcerned about having both devices answering at the same time when I discoveredthat I had other name choices (not enough for me but just enough to avoid confusion).I named him \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEcho.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Now if I could only choose a male voice. I loved that I could link it tomy security camera and my new doorbell. So many more features. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget to buy thestand/base. So many advantages to having that. Read the reviews. Highly recommend.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I love this little Spot more than I thought I would. The sound is great for such a little thing...my music plays nice and loud and clear. The video is terrific...I was watching some Prime shows just for the heck of it, and I was really impressed. Immediately convinced my mom to buy my sister one for her birthday!Only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars...I really wish it was cordless. I love having it in my kitchen but trying to find a place to plug it in is a pain. And it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t connect to my Bluetooth speaker while playing Amazon Prime Music for some reason, which is a drag when I want to hear it in the dining room during dinner. Of course, if it was CORDLESS I could just bring it with me...otherwise, I absolutely love it and will probably buy another one!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I bought on Prime Day and so glad I did. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to use and lots of customization options. I know some reviews said that the screen was small and hard to read, but I disagree.\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tHonestly I like it but at the same time I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I could have bought a smaller one that did the exact same thing for less then half I bought it for the video chat and I have never really used it\\t0\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Overall it\\'s great and I like that I can see lyrics and the time and  date. However, sometimes it freezes and doesn\\'t respond properly--no error message about lack of connectivity--it just stops. Resetting resolves the problem.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI love all that you can do with the Echo Spot!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tThe thing I like most about my Echo Spot is the voice command feature.  You can ask anything and get an answer or play any music without getting up to adjust the Echo. Easy to use\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"Love it!! Perfect for an alarm clock replacement, plus so much more!!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I love the Echo Spot as it is great for checking the weather along with many other things, but most important it works great as your alarm clock in your bedroom!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tWe absolutely love this product!!! Wish we would have bought this instead of the dots!!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"We like that we are able to get weather and other information quickly.  You can even hear music played. The speaker is clear.  We are enjoying it.  What we did not like because it was creepy was that the day before my husband played a particular song on our stereo for me.  The next day, I asked the Echo to play music from the same artist not specifying any particular song.  The Echo played the exact song by that same artist that my husband played on our stereo the day before.  It was a little disconcerting.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"I like echo spot. I bought it to use as an alarm clock. One negative that i didnt really think about, when you wake up in the morning and are somewhat groggy, its hard to tell alexa to turn off the alarm, or hard to remember commands to snooze for a few minutes. In this case a clock with buttons seems to work better\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tThis is our second Echo Spot - to go with out two Echo Dots - love the look and how Alexia responds.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove my Echo Spot!\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tIt is very slow compared to the echo\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI love the way it is designed. And you have choices for the face.  I use it for my bed side.  I drop in; on my echo in another part of the house frequently without yelling.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Terrific sound for a small device, and nice form factor for the nightstand. I like the convenience of seeing the time and temperature rather than asking Alexa. Not using video much, but it would be nice if the device had a square/rectangular screen.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tNew to Alexa. Like this spot a lot.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"It\\'s not perfect, but I really like this little gizmo. i bought it primarily for 2 purposes. First, so I could set wake-up alarms by individual days, and set the wake-up music individually by the day. Second, I wanted to control a bedroom light by voice, so I could shut it off as I was falling asleep, without having to get out of bed to turn a switch. The Echo Spot, together with a smart plug,has been able to accomplish that. A bonus has been getting Alexa to play music from my Amazon Prime playlists.What\\'s not so great is that sometimes Alexa has a really hard time understanding instructions, and repeating and altering the way you say things can get pretty frustrating. Hopefully the AI gets better in the future, along with added functions.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI love it.  It is so easy to use\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tPut this on my night stand to use as a clock and alarm. Works great. Every morning I get the weather and news when I get up. Also reminds me of all the appointments my wife and I have.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove it\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"Part of it is my fault, I thought it could be wireless.  Though for the price, I still feel like it should be. Also the sound quality and volume could be better. I prefer the tap. Unless you really want to have the call options but today most of us have phones, computers or iPads. Just not worth it.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tVery easy to use and much quicker then looking up everything on the cell phone.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI love my new Echo Spot!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I love this clock, I just have to tell it to set my alarm.  No more fussing with buttons!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tCouldn\\'t be more pleased. Amazon hit this one out of the park. Looks great and runs great. Love it!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tResponds easily and like the ability to do at night.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tEasy setup  Love it!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"Simply amazing what a awsome device. It never ceases to amaze me, wake up to big bang music, go to sleep softly falling rain. Drop in on the kids and keep in touch. I have just scratched the surface as to what this devise can do.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I was skeptical at first but &#34;it&#34; grows on you.  It looks good, so far.  I did, however, turn off the camera.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tSound quality is disappointing.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI love it!  I especially love that it is so small and does so much.  Got rid of my old CD/Alarm clock radio.  Much more room on nightstand.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tGreat sound and video plus all the great stuff that Alexa has to offer even turns my lights on and off\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tThe ease to use product\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"So far pretty happy with the Spot. For me it really is a glorified alarm clock/radio and I know I could have something more cost effective but eh, I like it. I had read the reviews about the scrolling issues and saw the one about how to make that stop and it did. So far so good.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I am just entering the &#34;smart&#34; technology world. I haven\\'t figured it all out yet, but so far it\\'s pretty cool!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"It was smaller than I had anticipated, and when I say that I very much mean it. However, it still works very well!

It sits on my nightstand! Only improvements I would make is having battery back up capability and the screen could be a tad bigger. But overall I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m happy I have it!

Even my \\xe2\\x80\\x98technically challenged\\xe2\\x80\\x99 wife already figured out how to video call our daughter.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I have been extremely impressed with the device as a whole. Completely changed sleep schedule and replaced my alarm clock. It is the perfect bedside counter device - alarm, wake up music, weather, top news stories, etc. Perfect device for what I wanted and does so much more than I expected it to do, calling feature is also a huge selling point. This is a must own item. Probably will grab more Echos in the future.\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"As an Alexa device, it works just as well as any of the other products.  Unfortunately it doesn\\'t go up from there.  The ability to play videos is very limited.  You CAN NOT play YouTube and when you can play a video the cropping of the screen makes it look very strange. There is quite a selection of clock faces, and you can control what is displays with one glaring and VERY ANNOYING exception.  You can\\'t turn off the &#34;Things to try&#34; screen You can turn off the screen scroll, but that defeats the purpose of having the screen.  I don\\'t need to be reminded every 5 seconds what things I can do with Alexa.  I don\\'t need the advertising, especially at the cost of this device.  Overall, its an expensive Alexa device with a screen that\\'s not very useful and annoying.  I would not recommend this until the Amazon people get their act together and come up with a screen that\\'s actually useful.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tSo far so good.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"This device is perfect for a smart nightstand clock. I love how it dims based on the ambient light in the room. Its the first nightstand clock I have had in my bedroom in years because the lighting and glow from typical alarm clocks bother me when trying to sleep. The screen on this dims when the lights in the room go out and is not bothersome at all.Overall a great addition to my smart home. Its nice to be able to tell Alexa to turn on/off the bedroom lights without even getting out of bed or reaching for your phone. I have a bunch of other Alexa devices, but this was the first one with a screen.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"I love this thing. I talk to it through walls and in other rooms. I have been an amazon lover for a while so I have amazon music unlimited, kindle unlimited, prime video, etc., so I was ready for this when it came out. The screen is just so nice to have.The only thing resembling a down side is that it doesn\\'t always perfectly understand which song I want to hear, but I do have a deep southern accent, lower Alabama, so I don\\'t speak English anyways.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tSmaller than I thought it would be. Happy I got a stand so it sits up higher on the bedside table.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tEcho Spot works well except it does not work with the Ring doorbell as it states on the website. Since they were sold as a pair I thought that it would be app ready.  Unfortunately that is not case.  Perhaps Ring will update so that they can be integrated.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tNice\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI like it\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t \\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"We\\'ve owned a number of Echo devices, but have viewed them as more of a toy than a tool.  Other than playing music through a sound system, we haven\\'t found much use for them.  We just don\\'t find the voice user interface to be all that efficient.  The Echo Spot solves the efficiency problem by displaying the information that you\\'re routinely interested in.  Furthermore, you can do some basic navigation using the touch screen as well as tailor the settings.  We now use these as bedside clocks.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI love my Echo Spot.  Waking to my favorite music.  Being able to completely turn off display at night so my bedroom is dark.  All the skills I have yet to try.  Easy to use.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I like how small it is, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still able to see my Ring cameras.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tGreat for checking in on my son after school when I\\'m still at work.

Infact I am in love with all members of my Alexa family. I have Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Plus and now this new toddler Echo Spot. Every variant has its own beauty. I love feel and size of Echo Spot. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fabulous as far as looks are concerned. It does not have great Audio quality (which I did not expect at the time of placing order because of its compact and small size). I bought it to connect with my Bose SoundTouch.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove this!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI love being able to have Alexa sing careless whisper into my ear to wake me up.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"Works great as a bedside clock but the microphone for Alexa doesn\\'t work as well as the normal Echo.  Sometimes Alexa doesn\\'t hear me when I try to interrupt her it to give new instructions.  The speaker also isn\\'t as good as the normal Echo.  Screen is small so not really useful for viewing any type of video or for seeing who\\'s at the front door.  But, it\\'s great for the bedside.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tFun tech toy\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove it. Small with good sound\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"With the combination of this, smart plugins, and the Alex app I can turn stuff on and off with my phone or telling Alexa to do it. I can order stuff, get answers, watch videos, get weather, set alarms, video call, and so much more with this device!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tGreat product\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"In a matter of minutes it became indispensable addition to our house. Extrimelly useful hub of information, music, automation, communication, and assistant in basic needs. Would love to have a voice personalization. Some things are better not to said aloud but typed (like door unlocking codes) but that is problem of unwitty developers. So far only positive experience. The privacy invasions is happened way before Alexa, it is on your phone no matter brand or carrier. To Alexa defence at list it has a button to turn a microphone off.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I love this device! It\\'s so great. What a great alarm clock and what a surprisingly good speaker! Only reason I didn\\'t give 5 stars was because it needs to have a few more features like playing YouTube videos, and Google play music. The camera is not very good in low light if you decide to drop in and it\\'s dark in the room.Other than those minor things, I love it. Great buy and would buy again\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tHands free control\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Great love the display and easy to use, though still learning what all it can do everyday.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"It has been able to interpret my instructions pretty well right from the start, even from a distance. A lot of the skills are excellent. I\\'ve added a few of the late shows to my flash briefing but it\\'s ridiculous that it can\\'t access YouTube.It might be important to note that adding an event to your calendar is a task; it seems to have difficulty with the time span of an event. I imagine this is a functionality people would use often.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tSetup was easy and it is a fantastic alarm clock\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Great product! Highly recommend getting the stand that goes under it, it sits much better on the desk.\"\\t1\\r\\n3\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tEh it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cool and all but also kinda boring I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really know what to do with it other than it being a desk clock so 3/5 is about right. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t connect to my Spotify unless it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s premium and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in college and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not paying or that or amazon music so\\t1\\r\\n3\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI am huge Amazon fan! First to have a kindle and the echo. I waited a bit on this but have wanted it for awhile. I do love it!! My kids love it! They love watching videos and the lyrics to the songs. Now the video calling feature is nothing like how the advertisement made it out. I thought as long as someone would FaceTime me I could do it through that and I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Spot to Spot. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even Skype (which I do often with my aunt). The is my major disappointment with it.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tLOVE LOVE LOVE THESE. The only think I notice is that it doesn\\'t pick-up my voice and commands as well as my Echo and Echo Dots (we have 4 Echo products throughout our house). I have this in the kitchen and in my bedroom as my alarm clock. I\\'m no longer searching for a pen and paper to make lists!!!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tLove my Amazon products\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove this\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Love my spot.

The screen is a major plus.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Didnt think id get an Alexa device, but this is perfect for my home office.  the screen adds just that little piece that makes it worth the extra cost of the other Alexa devices.  It can show lyrics of songs, play my xm radio, can show videos of movie trailers and news.  Its great!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI love it.  I made a group with my echo dot so I get music through my home.  I am waiting for the to go on sale again so hopefully I can get another spot for my bedroom..  I love the alarm and weather at the sound of my voice..\\t1\\r\\n1\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"When we first received this product, it was great.  However, about a week ago, the device served up a video advertisement around 10:30pm at night and scared myself and my family.  If you want to make sure you are protected and don\\'t allow video directly in your home, the spot is not a device that can keep you safe.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"It\\'s fun to use, and makes my life easier in some sense.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove it!\\t1\\r\\n1\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t \\t0\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t \\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I got my Echo Spot on Prime Day and love it. I think it still is a little expensive, but the chance to save $30 convinced me to buy it. I basically use it as a radio alarm clock because on my old radio the stations would sometimes not come in clearly. I also like the sleep sounds skill, and hearing the weather. I\\'m still exploring the other skills...just discovered some Star Trek sounds (Alexa, beam me up) which are fun!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove this! Replaced an old alarm clock in my bedroom with this.  Love that it dims at night. Very responsive to commands.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tLove my spot! She even more than I expected! Great size for a bedroom!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tSo far so good. Just got it and I am trying to figure out all the things it can do. The product itself is very well made.. And easy to set up.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tAfter only a couple of days Alexa did not answer. I have disconnected and will see if it does any better after reconnecting.\\t0\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Perfect! May favorite Alexa device by far, specially if you own ring cameras or amazon cam\\'s it does the job really well.  We changed our echo in the main living room and it seems to be more reactive. Good job Amazon!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tIs great. Use it for music mostly.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tIt won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t receive calls and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really hard to call someone who has another echo.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tThis is our first step into a smart home. Soon as I added one item to the grocery list I started loving it. My wife was so-so about it \\xe2\\x80\\x98til I opened rain sounds. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a convert. \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x89 LOVE these and the dots.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Like the little spot,  now our guest room is Alexa enabled.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tWe love our echo spots. We now have three through the house and like that you can drop in on the other spots. We do wish the clock faces had more customization options and that there were more faces in general.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very smart and sweet design\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tso far just ok\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove this for bedside clock/alarm/radio.  Face can dimat night so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not bright for sleeping.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tLove this product I use it as my bedroom clock perfect size with a lot of other options. The only thing I would like to see them add on to it is the ability to fall asleep to mu as if and set a timer for it to go off on it\\'s own. Like you can with tv t hcfe sleep mode.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove this. So glad I purchased\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI wanted to see my security video cameras without having to use my phone. Works great and extremely easy to set up.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tThe Echo Spot is great!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tWe bot 2 on Prime day one for use as a clock/radio in the bedroom and one in the family room to control lights and watch the front door when the doorbell rings.  Music sound is very good not as good as the Echo but way better than our Dots.  If we could only buy 1 Amazon device it would be the Spot.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI bought two one for my office and one for my bedside table. They are fantastic the screen is just big enough when using the drop in feature to communicate with my mom. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait for prime day again to get one for my moms bedside table.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"Fantastic product, absolutely love it!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove these!\\t1\\r\\n3\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI do like the product we bought it on Prime day but this week it was $30 cheaper then Prime day. Still a really cool device. I wish I would have waited.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tstill learning how to ise it but is DOES NOT disappoint. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m giving to everyone for Christmas so I can \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccheck in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on them unnannounced like they do me...just show up with no advanced warning!!!\\t1\\r\\n4\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tVery helpful with daily activities\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tExactly as advertised\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tIts very nice\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"More than I expected. I use it for timers, alarms, shopping lists, calendar events, news, weather, and so much more.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tGreat!\\t1\\r\\n4\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI really like it works well trivia games and shopping on it is fun.Sometimes it misunderstands what I say but other then that the speaker is decent video chat is good but you do need to be in a well lit room so the other end can see you lol.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tFun to work with still learning everything she can do\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tAwesome. I love that it shows the lyrics of songs!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove the alarm feature...just tell what time.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI think the dot listens better than spot.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tHad a dot and upgraded to this! I like it. My only complaint is the very short instructions\\t1\\r\\n4\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Big step up from the Dot! Dropped one star due to consistent delay in bringing up Ring Pro video, though looks great once the feed is displayed.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tEasy set up and to use. I bought two one for my house and one for my 75 year old grandfather. I set it up for him a gave him a 15 minute lesson and he calls me at least once a day it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s is great to be able to see him in between visits.\\t1\\r\\n2\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI wanted to use it as a clock in our bedroom.  But the font is too small to see from any distance.  And apparently you can\\'t change it.\\t0\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tGreat size for bedside. Plus it dims at night!!\\t1\\r\\n4\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I love it and it works great, the only issue is the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdrop in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d FaceTime like feature sometimes lags, but that could possibly be an issue with my WiFi for where we have it located in the house.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Love to have meditation music, I use it as a morning alarm, just to mention few in general I love it\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I don\\'t know why I like it, but I do. It\\'s like an all-in-one alarm clock.  If you have other alexa devices, you know what it is.  If you are looking to get an alarm clock, this is the one to get (yes, its much more than that).  It shows you the time, it shows you the weather, its touch screen, it shows you music lyrics, and it does all the things your typical alexa device does.  It\\'s quite loud for its size as well (sound way better than echo dot).  It also does video calling, which is pretty awesome.  The viewing angle is great, so even if its sitting fairly high up, you can still see the display well enough.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tQuick and easy to set up\\t1\\r\\n3\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI was hoping for a better clock face to make this an alarm clock replacement .  The display brightness dims too much at night to accomplish this task.The display works well for camera viewing.It is an attractive device. and a decent value at $99\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tGreat device\\t1\\r\\n4\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a fan of echo devices. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great alternative to a clean clock. I like using it to adjust the lightning in the room and listening to sounds to help sleep. My two year old sleeps so much better with it on. We also use it to tell my two year old stories. Only issue is the volume of alexa speaking when you tell her to turn off the lights is loud when the volume is set to what you want to listen to the music at night\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"I own 5 Echo devices, consider me addicted! This little number is awesome, not only do I like that it displays, the sound is great and it has the same dependable functionality as other Echo devices. One feature I really like is how it slowly dims after I turn off my bedroom light, so I have a night light for a bit. I love Echo devices and have just about run out of places to put them!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI enjoy this little thing a lot.  Will do almost anything.  I like the jokes it tells.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still learning different functions\\t1\\r\\n2\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tMeh\\t0\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tBest looking Echo device. Easy to use\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tA helpful product with a few glitches eg inability to occasionally access all flash briefing stations and understand or answer certain questions but Amazon will likely fix and improve it.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\twe like it. very convenient\\t1\\r\\n4\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI love the size of the echo spot. It fits on my nightstand but has all of the capabilities of my echo show. I like going to sleep with the lightening storm. The images along with the sounds are very relaxing. The calling and messaging feature is great. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s small enough to take with when we travel. I love and own most of the Alexa products. Our whole family uses them.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tThe amazon Alexa is so nice to have she wakes me up in the morning with alarms and is great if you have prime because she can do a lot more plays any songs you want her to play and she can even make playlists of your favorite songs i love the Alexa because she has games you can play ad you can watch videos or movie trailers on the screen!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tlove the spot\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tEasy to use easy to set up\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI love my echo spot that my daughter and son in law got me for my birthday. Alexa wakes me each morning and plays music when I ask.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"This product currently has two related software flaws that make it completely unusable:1) There is a &#34;card&#34; on the homescreen called &#34;Things To Try&#34; -- it\\'s an ad for other Alexa services you can try. You can turn off all the other homescreen cards, but not this one.2) By default, the homescreen cards &#34;cycle&#34; automatically, which is incredibly annoying. There is a setting where you can opt to have the cards only &#34;cycle once&#34; instead of &#34;cycle continuously&#34;, but critically *this setting does not work*. My unit has been set to &#34;cycle once&#34;, and the cards still continue to cycle all the time. Have rebooted the device, re-set, etc etc.Until these two obvious software issues are fixed, in my opinion the product is useless.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tGreat deal on prime day\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tno problem\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tExcelente su funcionamiento y llama la atenci\\xc3\\xb3n la rapidez de respuesta y el control que se logra a trav\\xc3\\xa9s de la utilizaci\\xc3\\xb3n con Alexa.

I had the Echo Dot on my nightstand, but I really missed a display. This is perfect and the speakers are excellent.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Yes it met my expectations.  The snooze on the alarm needs a but of work.  Tap it and it snoozes, swipe up and it prompts you to dismiss.  But without my glasses I can\\'t read it and often it just snoozes.  Then one day I must have dismissed tomorrow\\'s alarm because it never went off.  I have it set for Mon-Thu.  Fri I don\\'t need to get up early.  A more apparent indicator of the alarm set would be nice.  My old alarm had a red light.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Great product, and i like the screen for a alarm clock\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Such a fun, easy, and convenient device to have around the house. No need to pick up my phone to look something up, just a few words and the world is at your fingertips. The speaker puts off great sound and the screen is crisp. The price is right for a device like this.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"A great replacement for the bedside alarm clock, which had a funny habit of going off at 12am every time the cleaning ladies came through. We mostly use it to turn the ceiling fan lights on and off, while leaving the fan running. Only gripe would be the mic sensitivity, which doesn\\'t appear be as good as the View or Gen2. It can get a little frustrating having to repeat yourself.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tThis product has made my life much simpler with a little one. I use it a lot for music and when i have my hands full turning it on/off or up/down is a breeze.

I love the sleek look of the Echo Spot on my nightstand and how easy it was to set up and use. I also love that it scrolls the news, local weather, and give suggestions of what to ask Alexa. I use this as my alarm clock, speaker, and have it sync\\'d with the Etekcity Voltson Wi-Fi Smart Plugs to control the lighting in my apartment.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tLove it\\t1\\r\\n1\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tYou need a Harvard law degree to operate this thing!

While I probably wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t watch a movie I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been dying to see on this, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great way to listen to music, watch a quick YouTube video, etc. I even attempted watching \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJaws\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on this and while it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the most comfortable thing for my eyes to do, it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t as bad as one would think.

Little because its trying to fit it into a circle.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove the ease of use and convenience the echo spot has offered\\t1\\r\\n1\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Great product and I would give 5 stars - but you can\\'t scroll face cards without having the stupid &#34;try and ask Alexa&#34; suggestions pop up.  Yes you can have it scroll once, and just stay on the clock, but I like having other cards as well. God its the worst and SO irritating.  I got it super cheap, so i just face the screen toward the wall and treat it like a Dot instead of a Spot.  What a dumb move on Amazons\\xe2\\x80\\x8b part.\"\\t0\\r\\n4\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Love that I have command access to news such as Bloomberg TV, NPR, etc.Highly recommend that you gain access to Alexa app before setting up Device and get familiar with key features/services...such as setting up your daily commute.If family and friends have Spot...then it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great substitute for Skype and Face Time...you can always \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdrop in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when missing loved ones or just to catch up.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tgood size screen and gets good range for voice commands. sometimes it picks up weird commands when I\\'m watching tv though. Great product for the price if you don\\'t need the big show screen.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t26-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"It is a good addition to my small space, and it keeps me up to date on events and weather conditions.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tBest thing I have ever owned!

He loves it as his alarm clock and smart device. This is our 3rd Echo device, and we have them all connected throughout the house. Although you can deactivate the camera, we also chose to cover it since the device is in our bedroom. I\\'m not comfortable with having a camera in the room (no, we don\\'t bring our cell phones in the room).\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Great product, what they don\\'t tell you is that once you allow a &#34;Drop In&#34;  they can drop in anytime!!!  While they are sleeping, while we are yelling at them, while anything.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I have two. One in my computer room and the other that I move around out on the deck. Not great for watching video, but it can be done. With the added sound you don\\'t get from the Echo Dot, it is perfect for the location I have it in. Add whole house music, and you have just arrived in Nervana.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t25-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tSurprisingly handy. Wish it had more options geared towards it being on your nigh stand.

But...OMG this is by far the coolest thing I have ever had.  It does everything short of clean your house... which, when I asked Alexa to clean my house.... was told she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have hands, but instead played a fantastic playlist for cleaning!  From reading books to my five year old, to video chat, to silly selfies, music that automatically goes to my Bose Bluetooth speaker, setting timers, alarms, changing my thermostat on voice command, tells me the weather, sends hubby a grocery pick up list, and I am sure. Million more things!BUY IT.....you u will not regret it.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t24-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"This product is beautifully designed and I no longer have to hide an Echo device away like I did with Dot.

When in \\'Clock\\' mode, the screen rotates between the clock face and a \\'Things to Try\\' screen.  I intended on buying several units for my house, but I do not need a screen in the house that is permanently trying to upset me.  Acting as clock should be a BASIC feature of the Echo Spot.  How could you get this wrong, Amazon??  #FAIL\"\\t0\\r\\n2\\t24-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I wanted to use this as a bedside clock with the ability to play music and podcasts.

In order to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning you pretty much have to talk - which is not a thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like.  YES, you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i) swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii) if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss, then you completely delete your recurring alarm.This is especially annoying as Amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but NOT delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off.  But as the clock has been out for a year now and they still haven\\'t adding this setting, clearly not going to happen.  This may be the biggest product design screw up Amazon has ever made.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t23-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tExcellent\\t1\\r\\n2\\t23-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"item returned for repair ,receivded item back from repair 07/23/18 . parts missing no power cord included.please advise\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t23-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tAwesome item that I had to buy two!\\t1\\r\\n2\\t23-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"For as awesome as the Echo and Echo Dots are, the Spot is a disappointment. There is very little control over what the screen shows, what the clock looks like, what order things show up in, etc. At this point if I hadn\\'t thrown the box away immediately, I would have sent it back and just got another full size Echo.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t23-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tIt has replaced my clock and Google Mini on my nightstand.

I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t realize this until I read the reviews on the Alexa skill for syncing the Nest Cam.  Considering all of the poor reviews and the fact that it should be simple to fix, surprised Amazon hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t upgraded the software to allow more than 39 minutes of viewing or alerts like you get on the Nest app.\"\\t0\\r\\n3\\t22-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Would be 5 stars if you could turn off the &#34;Things to Try&#34; screen!!!  I should have read up on this before buying the Spot.  Amazon, please update to enable us to turn this off!

So great to use!!!\\t1\\r\\n1\\t22-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I own 3 of these...  amazon is ignoring its customers and using these devices as a marketing tool.  You can customize the screen contents, but you cannot turn off there advertising, Things to Try...  People will suggest that you can, but you can only do so if you turn off all content changes which is not an acceptable option.Moreover, they should increase the size slightly, and improve the audio speaker.  That would give you a 5 star device.Right now i\\xe2\\x80\\x99m debating whether to return all 3 devices.  My wife says we should.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t22-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I never thought I was going to be THAT person that is completely connected. I purchased this and another Echo product on Prime Day and fell in love.  I have one in my office and one in our kitchen.  I have already used this for morning briefings from the News while I am getting ready for the day as well as look up recipes.  The screen is big enough for me to easily read writing (this was a concern for me).  I loved this so much I purchased it for my grandparents and parents so they can easily video call me as they tend to have issues with their computer and other video conferencing tools.  Note: I did purchase camera covers (even though there is a button to &#34;turn off the camera and microphone&#34; and it doesn\\'t impede the operations and camera so if that is what you are worried about, there are work around!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"LOVE love love this!  I have an echo, and several echo dots, but love the video with this and the clock.  I no longer have to wake up and say &#34;Alexa, what time is it?&#34; or &#34;Alexa, weather&#34;  I can even watch videos on it if i forget my kindle before bed.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tAfter purchasing my Echo Spot to add to our other 4 Amazon Echoes...I am very pleased with the Echo Spot...I use  it with our Arlo Security cameras and Ring video doorbell and works without any problems...\\t1\\r\\n1\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tDisconnects often\\t0\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"It does so much more than I knew when I bought it. It pretty much runs my house, helps me fall asleep, takes care of my schedule, and entertainment\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Love, love so far. I just received it Thursday. I unwrapped it, set it up, & immediately programmed it. No problem with the reoccurring things to try. I set it to rotate once and shows time like I want. I love the low ambient look at night.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"This is the best Alexa enabled device you can get, it is so versatile and useful. It sound way better than the dot but not as good as the regular echo. The screen makes all the difference in the world.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I needed an alarm clock and this fit the bill perfectly.  I am a believer in amazon echo, Alexa and fire.  Great customization options and Alexa is always helpful.  Sound quality is also surprisingly good.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tYou\\'re going to have to shell out an extra $20 bucks for the stand that should come with it so you can angle it best for how ever you are using this. My biggest gripe. I already spent an arm and a leg on this it should come with the stand.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t21-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"Love it except that Amazon needs a reference one cohesive link for a full user manual. I don\\'t have hours to research websites. Plus, more instruction from Alexa on skills would be great. We often get the answer, \"\"I don\\'t know that skill\"\" even though I\\'ve added it in the app. I.e. Kwikset or Pizza Hut.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tSuch a handy item to have on my night stand. She reads to me at night and gets me all set for the day in the morning with my calendar and weather views.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t \\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I got this on Prime day and figured I\\'d see what all the hype is about.  Honestly I didn\\'t really want to like it as personally bugging my house seems kinda weird, but honestly, I love it.  Like it or not this is the way the world is going, so why not.I loved it so much I ordered 2.  I didn\\'t get the Show because it looks like it came from the 1990\\'s and is downright ugly.  I have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway, so the Spot\\'s screen does not bother me - although it is very clear.Alexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere.  My favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it\\'s hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar - where I can just say play any song I want and it will.  I guess I could just pick up my smartphone to do that, but you don\\'t know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pages.The one thing that I am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much - they also do not rotate when playing music.  I\\'d love for it to display the weather as I listen to music.The screen is clear and I also really enjoy Alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be - there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to 5 different places (that you program and name) so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents - and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic.  I have this programmed for my parents, fiances parents, work, and her work.  So it really works great.The one thing that I actually preferred the Dot over the Spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications.. I have not seen the Spot really do much for package notifications yet.  The dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered.  I would recommend Amazon do exactly what they did for the Dot but on the Spot - the Dot lights up colors - why can\\'t the Spot ?  The same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring, just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for delivery.Overall it\\'s a great device that I am looking forward to integrating my home around.  I\\'m already looking at dash buttons, smart plugs, etc..- and = when I become a home owner instead of renting where I can\\'t tinker with my thermostat I will be purchasing a Nest down the road for HVAC integration.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"The screen response time is way better than I expected. Sound quality is good too, also it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not so bright that I have to turn off the screen but it is an option.  I have a Dot in another room and which ever hears me better is the one that responds.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove it!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I LOOOOOOOVE this thing! :) Watching movies on it is a bit of a disaster because of the round screen, but other than that it\\'s a GREAT chachki toy :)\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tWe gave the Echo Spot as a gift to my mother in law.

Very satisfied so far..\\t1\\r\\n5\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Great product, need a bit a adjustment to set up spotify, time, weather, etc.. in Hong Kong, but works fine now. I used it as alarm clock + music in bedroom, love it.\"\\t1\\r\\n3\\t20-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"I bought this to replace a Dot in my bedroom. Already have a Show and a couple of full-sized Echo units in my house.The Spot is okay for what it is. Two issues, one minor and one major:-the minor one - why include the huge bezel on the front? Why not take that space and make the display larger? A total waste of usable space.-the major one, also involves the Show: I\\'m very used to these devices. I don\\'t need to see &#34;Things to Try&#34; whenever I use a voice command with it (even setting it to rotate once starts this crap over again when you dare to actually use the devices). I\\'m not a child and I don\\'t need to be told a hundred times how to play music on it. And having this on my nightstand and seeing these highly annoying tips is just outrageous for a unit meant to be used next to a bed. Why doesn\\'t Amazon fix this and give us the option to turn this nonsense off? I want to see a clock face, period, not these silly nanny reminders.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tThis product just looks adorable in any room and I love it.

I\\'ve been using for a couple months and if you\\'re an amazon prime subscriber the value here is greater than google. I\\'m using to listen to free music with prime (better than alternatives), audible and you can even watch movies. The display is a little small for lots of watching, the sound should be louder, and YOUTUBE NEEDS TO BE AVAILABLE. These issues put this at a 3.5 to 4 stars. Fix one of them (youtube) and its a 5 star item. To alleviate sound I\\'ve paired with a blue tooth speaker. Right now this sits in my living area. Where I think it will shine is my office desk. Once there are great offers I could see purchasing additional for nightstand or other Amazon Alexa items for my household. I felt happy after adding this to my house where as I felt stupid using google home.\"\\t1\\r\\n3\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI like it as an Alexa device but its small.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tWhat a wonderful little Alexa enabled gadget at like the analog clock face the best\\t1\\r\\n5\\t20-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"Love it, Love it, Love it!!!

It works great for what I use it for: an alarm clock, a weather station, background music player and voice control of lights throughout my house. My biggest gripe about the device and why I knocked a star off is that you can\\'t turn off the suggestions on &#34;Things to Try&#34;. It \\'s an annoying and a stupid design decision since you have control to turn off other things you don\\'t want to see as it cycles through content screens. A software update or two would help this improve especially full control of what we want and don\\'t want to see in the content rotation.\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t19-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tCan\\'t turn of &#34;things to try&#34; on the screen scroll.

It was already setup. Should be a simple thing to check  time before asking. Wife not happy...\\t0\\r\\n4\\t19-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tThe echo spot is really great. I just got it and is easy to set up. I do have one problem. When the advertise it they show a screen with the time weather and your town. Sadly there is no way to make this the home screen. The home screen is just the time\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x94. I spoke to support and the wonderful lady tried and researched for 45 minutes to no avail. I am disappointed because I wanted that screen all the time not just during an occasional screen rotate. I am hoping they will do something about this. Other than that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great\\t1\\r\\n1\\t19-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"The product is attractive and somewhat useful, BUT, Amazon chose to force users to view their \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthings to try\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and Trending\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  This greatly depreciates the value of the product.  Do not buy unless you are willing to view a billboard from Amazon.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t19-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"The Echo Spot has really helped me to streamline my day and be more efficient!

The round screen is an interesting choice and I\\'m not sure I like the look but it is growing on me. The speakers could be slightly louder but all in all it is a solid echo product.\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t19-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"It\\'s not as good as Siri, BUT it still has some positives, it\\'s great at playing music, and setting alarms. I personally felt that I paid too much for this product, as it was nearly half off on prime day (literally the day after I purchased it). So I\\'m pretty disappointed. I might still return it and get my money back. .\"\\t0\\r\\n4\\t19-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Having received this as a gift, I am writing my initial thoughts: (compared to my google home mini)PROS:  Way easier to setup than the google home mini.  I was able to connect ALL of my smart home device (unlike google) without any issues.  Making phone calls on this was clearer for the receiver to understand me.CONS:  Need to enable \\'skills\\' to get more functionality.  Google home has built in functionality to search the web for answer to questions easier than  the amazon echo.  Could not connect this to youtube.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t19-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove it\\t1\\r\\n5\\t18-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tWell-made product.Echo Spot - White\\t1\\r\\n5\\t18-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Installed on my back porch, works very well!  I did have to get the wall mount for it, which also works well.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t18-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Thank God, and alarm clock with an lcd that gets dim enough for me to sleep. I\\'m a very light sensitive sleeper and wind up taping black tape over all my other stuff in my bed room. Not this guy. The Alexa features are nice and listening to music at night is great. We enjoy falling asleep to meditation podcasts though we have to use the skill anypod to get the podcasts we like. Video is kinda tiny and useless at this size but that\\'s to be expected. Audio quality is much better than echo dot.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t18-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"I love this thing. At first I thought it wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stay on the clock and that I would have to suffer through ads forever but when the lights are off it sits on the clock and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very comfortable for the eyes, easy set up.

People think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m crazy for paying this much for a glorified alarm clock. But I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care!! For me, waking up in a good mood is pretty important and this helps me do it!! So glad I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to deal with my old EEAANH EEAANH EEAANH alarm. Very excited to say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlexa, turn off the lights\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (smart plugs get here soon!) Got a camera privacy slide for this since it is in my bedroom.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t18-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I absolutely love this! Very user friendly and I got the Kasa Cam to go with it to monitor my living room. Super easy to set up and operate. I only wish it actually came with the camera privacy cover and pivoting stand which you can buy separately. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking forward to future software updates for different clock faces. I like digital but I miss the colon in between the hours and minutes on most of them. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d also like to see more celebs jump on board for the alarm voices.

Within months it started acting funny and would stop working\\xe2\\x80\\x94called and they determined that it was overheating. I was told to unplug and technical support would call within 24-48 hours. Waited 48 hours without response and replied to email and was asked to wait a week. A week goes by with absolutely no response so I do the inline chat per instructions. Told to wait longer. REALLY????  Unacceptable\\xe2\\x80\\x94expected more from Amazon. Find it funny how they always thank me for being a Prime member but when an issue arises I cannot even get assistance.\\t0\\r\\n4\\t17-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"Much easier to use than the dot. It picks up my voice from farther away and the speakers seem a lot cleaner sounding The screen is a nice perk but I only use it at bed time to listen to prime shows before bed, the screen is too small to watch shows..It displays my alarm in print so I know Alexa heard me correctly. and you can make you own clock face with personal pictures.  My only complaint is that they don\\'t add the stand as standard. I didn\\'t need it for my spot at my desk but definitely needed it beside the bed.Many people complain about the basic Alexa program but it is still such new tech that I\\'m not going to split hairs.  The echo was not as good as my dot and the spot is better than dot.  Alexa gets better over time and the skills are increasing weekly. Now Alexa even tells the difference between my son and my voice. I think Amazon is working overtime on this project. I gave feedback to ask to be able to have self made lists and now you can make and name lists for anything.I am so used to my Alexa that I talk to her even when I\\'m staying in a hotel and she\\'s no where to be found.  Alexa, what time is it?  ALEXA???!!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t17-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"When we were buying another product there was an option to bundle this one for an extra $30...so we thought why not? Well, I\\'m so glad we did! We are really enjoying our Echo Spot. It reads stories to our girls, plays music, gives us the news, and so much more!  It\\'s so responsive and has so many skills that we enjoy.\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t17-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tFor the size of the screen this thing should be $25\\t0\\r\\n3\\t17-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"This is 1 of 6 echo devices in the house and is currently being deployed as a bedside alarm clock.  I use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video.  Audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video.  Much of the time it works well as alarm clock, but there are some serious flaws, particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake.  It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with 2 people on different schedules.  Try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlexa set an alarm for 5am\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and then having Alexa repeat \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOK alarm set for 5am.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Not good.  I suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid.  Plain and simple, this device needs to be brought into the 1990\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm.  I know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone.  No thanks, if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m picking up my phone to set an alarm I will just use its built in alarm and save a step.  At least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen, so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse.  The interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great.  There should be separate snooze and cancel buttons.  Currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels.  It is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled.  When the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later, my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning Alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in the shower.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t17-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI bought this for my mother and she loves it! I want to get one for myself now!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t17-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t \\t1\\r\\n1\\t17-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tInvasive and scared the crap out of me for speaking when it was not spoken to! CREAPY AF\\t0\\r\\n4\\t16-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"4 out of 5 stars. I have the Original Tall Echo, 4 dots, 2 spots and 1 Show.  The only thing I\\'m finding a problem with is the speakers in the Spot. when using Drop In.  Sometimes I\\'m not being heard on the other spot and vice versa.  The voices tends break up or the sound coming through is intermittent. The optical is fine........ it\\'s just the sound. Sometimes I\\'ll have to repeat the wake word 2-3 times and I\\'m only 8 feet away plus it\\'s on one of those $20 stands.  I find the ECHO DOT, Original echo and the Show has much better sound quality.  That\\'s one reason I bought the Echo Show.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t16-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I bought this for my 90 year old grandmother and she and I love it!!! She can call all her family members with just her voice, play games, even watch a video and I love that I can \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdrop in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on her any time to see how she is doing.

As a Mom of two things can get hectic really quickly trying to manage everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s schedules & my own. I just verbally tell Alexa what reminder or timer I need set and Voila!Having my Spot has given me the virtual assistant I so desired without having to actually hire someone.  Not to mention the many other awesome features. I have Alexa synced with my Audible & Kindle & Alex can read a book from my libraries to me.I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still excited to see what else my Spot can do!Side note: I had wanted to purchase a Show for a while & probably still will down the line however I sooooo love my sleek little Sopt!\\t1\\r\\n1\\t15-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I love the product , but very disappointed once I  realized I can no longer play youtube videos.  I\\'m now past my 30 days return date.  I am realizing I now have an expensive alarm clock.  I am hoping youtube comes back.  I was looking to buy an echo show for the kitchen during prime day. Glad I didn\\'t.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t15-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure why or how Amazonia asking me about this purchase.

I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really had much use for it as no one calls, they text. So that part meh.

Unfortunately a lot of the functionality is lost because, as many have mentioned, it does not work with google or Youtube any more.

Super easy to set up & get started, a breeze to do routine tasks (set alarms, timers, add items to shopping/to do lists, play music, get news, just about anything it\\'s supposed to do). The sound is good where Imhave it sitting, not tinny at all as some have found. There is one thing I HATE & it would keep me from recommending it to anyone - you cannot delete from the nice screen the continually running suggestions of what to ask Alexa. Unless you have her turn off the screen totally which I do when I go to bed. And it\\'s too bad bc it\\'s like a continuously running advertisement or set-up guide. Not attractive. The echo show was on sale prior to Prime day for less than the Echo, so I figured I was getting a great deal for my money when trying to decide which device to start out with. Because of the ever present script it\\'s not a nice device to look at, I would not buy it again, or recommend - go with the Echo. I may still exchange the product.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\tVery excited to see what it can do\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"This is great for music, video calling, kitchen timers, and probably a bunch more. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the ever-floating \"\"things to try\"\" on the home screen. This is purely an aesthetic complaint, but hopefully soon Amazon allows the option to shut it off.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t\"I love the idea is the star trek computer at home.

I have one in the kitchen and wanted another in my home office.It is amazing for a quick look up while I am working. I live a very busy life and it helps keep me on track with work and personal appointments.I will buy for holiday gifts for my whole family. The gift of organization and information at a voice command away.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t \\t0\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t\"Don\\'t waste your money.  I own an echo gen 1, and echo gen 2 and a dot. They all do a far better job of voice recognition that the Echo Show.  In fact, it is so bad that it is virtually useless.  Also, the speaker is incredibly bass heavy....so much so that it is hard to understand voices.  I\\'ve worked to adjust the bass and punch the mids and treble, but it still sounds awful.  Finally, the screen just doesn\\'t add much.  I can\\'t see if from across the room, it rarely activates in any meaningful way, and when it doesn\\'t, it is more of a distraction than a help.(Using FaceTime is so much more practicalthan using the Show.) I\\'m surprised Amazon didn\\'t make this a little more useful than it is.  Perhaps in the future, but for now, it is a waste of time and money.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tI love it. It does everything.\\t1\\r\\n2\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tThought it would be more powerful and have a lot more functionality. Not much better than the Echo dot.

Oh, it also has a built in camera for taking pics.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"My wife has been using Skype for years to talk to her parents daily, with constant technical issues.  Since her father is 88, it\\'s a lot to ask the man to uninstall/reinstall/reconfigure Skype, but he does.  When I saw these on sale, I jumped on them.  My wife was resistant to &#34;learn a new technology&#34;, but I told her these just work - like the video phones I saw at the New York World\\'s Fair in 1964 - 54 years ago!Yesterday it set up quickly and worked fine, with no issues.  My wife told her co-worker today and she went out and bought 3 - one for herself and her husband, and one for each set of parents.

Also, I thought I could have the weather for an area displayed continuously,  but I have to talk to Alexa, which I don\\'t want to do in the middle of the night. Had I payed full price it would have been returned. There are other features that are nice, but I may never use them.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tWe held off purchasing an Echo but couldn\\'t resist during Prime Days.

Do manufacturers truly believe that user will magically know the full capabilities of each product purchased? I have no idea of the echo show\\'s capabilities. I have it linked to my Hue lights, but have no idea what commands will work, and what won\\'t. I purchased a Fire TV Stick along with the Show, but have no idea how to maximize the two. Just a few examples.I even purchased a text that other users have found to be helpful. Seems way too basic to me, but better than a kick in the pants.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tIt\\'s a fun item to have.  Has a lot of udefulness.

It rarely gets what I say correct, does not control the Dish receiver.  Yes I set it up correctly, using the alexa app on my phone.  We got this for 129,  which is a good deal, ti is definately not worth the 229 price though.  Maybe in another month it will get better, or either I have one that is just deaf and dumb.

SO I am stuck, unable to program my echo show properly. In my opinion you should be able to tell the echo show what you need done. and the echo show does it. every time i ask for something I am referred back to the alexa app.on your mobile device, which I cannot access.To me this is not intelagence but dependence on other equipment to function.Every thing today is pushed to the phone,  because the phone has been made accessable,  to all those who wish  to gather information\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tGreat in the kitchen.  I love to cook and it is fun to look up recipes.  Also great for listening to music and watching shows on Amazon Prime Video while I cook.  I subsequently bought an Echo Dot with the ihome clock docking station for the bedroom.  I created a group so I can play music on both of them at the same time.

It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definitely a source of relief to my parents that they can so easily pop in onme and visa versa.I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d also like to thank Amazon for including their VoiceView screen reader on the device.

I have the dot and have been using that for the last 6 months,  but the Show is so much better.  The sound quality is amazing and the screen resolution is like watching a mini 4K tv.  I love being able to see my timers, events and list instead of having them read to me.  I purchased this on prime day, and it is worth every penny.

The problem is, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so much it can do that I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been able to explore the extent of its abilities! I got the special price as part of the Prime Day promotion...and you just can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t beat what you get for the price.  Very pleased with the sound. The video screen is sharp. Sometimes it takes a few tries to get Alexa to perform a command...but as I get to know the system better, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hoping that will improve.  One drawback in the music...I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed a lot of the songs from years past, are re-recordings by the original artist...but not the original recording itself.  Example: Secret Agent Man by Johnny Rivers...a \\xe2\\x80\\x9clive\\xe2\\x80\\x9dversion is used, not the original version.  If I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to pay for Prime Music...I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to hear the original version of songs...not later recordings.  Or at least give me a choice of what I want to hear.

Although I haven\\'t and probably won\\'t use the video functions. I had hoped that the display would be allow for more customization. It does not and is very limited. I would like the clock and weather to display in large text all of the time, it only displays in very small text. It also always has a line that says &#34;Tell Alexa to do this, or that&#34;, tips at the bottom of the screen. I would like to see that go away, but it won\\'t. Sound quality is good, not as good as the big Echo, but good enough. I bought it on sale and think I got value for what I paid. I would have been disappointment had I of paid full price.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tLove my echo show!\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tI enjoy this thing.

I bought it to be a abay monitor combined with a wifi camera, and that works.  But the screen is always on unless you tell it to turn it off - instead of just a talking cylinder you now have a mini screen that not only talks to you but also writes out everything it says or shows accompanying video.  There is something about only audio that made Alexa different, no I some ways it is a TV that you can talk to.\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tIt f****** sucks\\t0\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t \\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\tLove being able to read the lyrics of my favorite songs.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"This thing is awesome for grocery lists, paired with the AnyList app. The flash briefing is very good too. My only complaint is that once you pause something, Alexa decides that you no longer want to listen to that thing. Forever.

It stops working, and the blue bar just flashes. I keep having to unplug and restart the device. Once I do that, it starts working again. So irritating.

It has a problem which requires it to be on for a while for the defective part to show itself.I sent it for repair and got it back without being fixed.

I use it to set timers when cooking because my stove is being finicky and not wanting to work most of the time. I also use it to check for different recipes, listen to music and my all time favorite.... telling everyone it is time for dinner. My son gets a real kick out of that!I know a lot of people are expecting more out of their shows then it is possible to at the moment, but remember the original echo didn\\'t have what it has now when it first came out. I see that Amazon is adding new stuff all the time and soon I am sure it will have all that we want very soon.... maybe even things we haven\\'t thought of!I do wish it was a bit more user friendly. I still haven\\'t figured out how to video chat with my cousin in North Carolina who also has one, and when I tried to call my son\\'s dot it went to video chat immediately, last I looked, dots don\\'t have video screens!Another thing that needs to be addressed is when my husband tried to have the one in our bedroom play thunderstorm sounds to help him go to sleep, it tried to get him to buy an app instead of playing the skill I had enabled that was free. So now he is a bit worried to use it again. That needs to be fixed.I do have to say that all in all I am very happy with my Echo Show!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\tI have not had it very long. It\\'s my first Alexa thing.

Also, I can\\'t talk to the person at the door through the echo show, only through my cell phone.\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"Great device, features are awesome, the interaction is fantastic. Home automation works perfect if you link up your accounts correctly. My only issue is out of (4) Echo Shows (2) of them have been sent off for repair because of the screen glitching!! These are less than 3 months old and already having issues!First repairs were sent off and they \\xe2\\x80\\x9cupdated the firmware\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when I got the device back nothing worked, I had to update to the newest firmware for it to work again.

Especially for the video chat.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"I\\'ve had an Alexa Dot for some time but I\\'m really enjoying the Alexa Show. It\\'s great to have a visual whether it\\'s a song or the weather. Played Jeapordy, but I\\'m not good at it. You do learn trivia and no one\\'s watching! Love that recipes are visible and movies are available. Haven\\'t had it long enough to try everything.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tGot this on Amazon prime with the ring pro. Work really great. Being the lazy guy I am I don\\'t need to go see who at my door anymore while I\\'m gaming.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"We originally got the Show to video chat family members, and it works great for that. We have found that we really like checking things hands-free like the weather and recipes. So far we have really liked the Show, and would recommend it!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tEasy setup. Was up and running in minutes. The learning feature is outstanding. Now I know why Amazon is so far ahead of the competition.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"I bought this product hoping that Alexa would be pretty well developed and far enough along, therefore expecting her to be responsive. This $100 piece of crap doesnt even know how to respond to a question that amazon themselves told me to ask her. (Echo buttons manual, see Step 3.) The device has potential given it has a big screen, decent sound but for 200 bucks, I would never reccomend it. Even for the $100 I spent, I feel like I got shorted. Oh and lastly, the device is pretty useless without a prime membership. I linked my personal account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker. I went on the family account (this one) and got it to work minimal. Oh, and even with our prime membership, you have to have a music pass or something that\\'s an extra 3.99 a month, leaving this item a subscription nightmare, and a overpriced, decorated bluetooth speaker in my eyes. I would give it zero stars if I could.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t\"quite nice...clear, great sound.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"Versatile use, can watch movies or news.  Able to use as remote for vehicle.  Or use as a communication hub for the home.  Great produc!!!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tI bought two.  One for me and one for my daughter who lives in another state.  We love it!!\\t1\\r\\n1\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t\"Our family bought several of these to help communicate with older parents and grandparents who need simpler devices than a full-fledged tablet.  What fantastic potential these have - for digital photo screen, video calls, easy accesss to music, audio books, etc. However, once we have them setup, we discovered the huge lurking negative.  Amazon forces you to view continous spam on the home screen promoting all their Alexa features.  You can turn off many other things in settins, but you cannot turn off &#34;Things to Try&#34;.  Instead of a beautiful digital photo screen with weather and time ... we now constantly have a spam ad across the home screen that says, &#34;Try ......&#34;.  AMAZON, please listen to your customers and offer a setting to turn off this SPAM!\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tThe best part about owning this is that my mother who is anti-technology uses this with ease everyday and finds new reasons to use it as well. Well done.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my second one, so I put this one in the kitchen for recipes.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\tEcho Show is perfect for staging in the kitchen so recipes are right there. No need to print them. Wonderful device. Acoustical sounds are not as powerful as our tall cylindercal echo but we have that covered in the adjacent family room.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"Great fun but frustrating at times. Commands between tv and the show get mixed (asking to watch something will turn my directv, not display on show which stinks with an 8 year old) Also would like more video options with flash briefings. Still really a tech wonder for a low price.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tLove that you can play music and see the lyrics.  Connected to my echo dot I enjoy listening in multiple rooms.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"I love Alexa and when I had the chance to add Show to my home... I jumped at it.  But... I\\'m a member and my Show doesn\\'t know I paid for the extras with my Echo (now in the upstairs bedroom.

Must be on the same bandwidth as other Alexa devices for whole home music. 2.4ghz vs 5ghz.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"I am pleased with the Echo Show, from the sound of the music and the words to the tunes to the news and weather.

Awesome!!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"The packaging was beautiful and then there she was!! We have 2 dots and an echo plus already. Now we have the show and we love it. An echo for each room!You can also say &#34;Alexa, turn off the screen&#34; and it will go black. This is good for sleeping.\"\\t1\\r\\n3\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t\"The ability to respond with the accuracy and variety of information provided by Google search has spoiled me.I had originally expected to see that the same type of search engine in the Echo.Not so, the ability of Alexa to provide such detailed information is not part of the package.Perhaps improvements are in the offing with further updates.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t\"My daughter has an Echo Show and she told me how much she loved it. I bought a white one for my kitchen and absolutely love it!  It has all the features of the others plus great extras. The sound system is awesome. I also own the original Echo Tower, Dots and Spot. Each are great and have their uses around my house. I highly recommend all of these products.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tReally like the show me feature. I also like video calls with others.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"I love this device.  I bought it simple so that I can have an alarm clock with my Amazon Echo.....and during Prime day for the price you couldn\\'t beat it.  But, I have Sonos and Big Ass Fan lights that I am able to control with this device.  It\\'s perfect and getting better all the time.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tThe ase of participating with Echo\\t1\\r\\n3\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"I like the weather options but Alexa search compacity needs improvement. She aint no Google. Alexa gets our requests probably around 20% of the time. Currently Alexa doesn\\'t do YouTube either. This is a huge drawback and why The echo show dropped in price.  International radio via tune in is awesome but again her search engine, its like pulling teeth to get to anything.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tLove it!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tLOVE!! i still haven\\'t figured out all the best things we can do with it.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t\"Easy to use, Answers all my questions,Hands free, What\\'s not to like , It may not be perfect but it is  a sign of the times to come, can be connected to smart home items, I enjoy it totallly,, Keeps your home connected\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tThis product is amazing!

We also use it for maintaining lists, as a music player, general information, and entertainment.

I have a white kitchen, so now I have this stands-out-like-a-sore-thumb black power cord. For aesthetic purposes, I was happier with my year-old white Echo (not Show) because it came with a white powercord. This seems like a major design flaw in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhite\\xe2\\x80\\x9d option. I strongly urge Amazon to change out the powercord to white.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tI am very pleased with the Echo Show! I love that it has so many nice features. I highly recommend it.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tThe ease of set up and overall functionality makes this Echo show worth every penny.  I especially like setting my background screen and being able to set affirmations that I use as personalized reminders.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tI love it!

A bit disappointing, but not the end of the world, I used it like I use my other, screenless echos.... For a little under 2 month, when the screen started flickering, mostly on the bottom of the screen but not just. A quick look in some forums made me understand it is pointless asking for a replacement, as some people had 2-3 devices replaced, only to start flickering again shortly after. Amazon are not providing any serious answers, and this has been going on for quite some time apparently.Long story short, I moved it to the hallway, and been using it as a very expensive... and bulky voice activated light switch for my hue lights. So like the headline suggests... Meh.\"\\t0\\r\\n4\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tLove it to play music works great for finding recipes.

It\\'s also a little harder for it to pick up what you\\'re saying.

Overall it works well, but does not seem as adept at doing things as the original Echo Plus.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tThis is my second Show.  I like them very much.

Also, we should be able to name it on our own instead calling Alexa or Echo. Price can be reduced a bit (value based) and updates should be auto and daily to improve it.

I think I heard her sigh in exasperation.I tried to create a playlist of songs I like only to have it ignored.  I am learning workarounds but they are mediocre, at best...and, as yet do not include a personal playlist.I have scoured the beginners section but the beginners it addresses are far more advanced in basic Alexa than am I.So far, I like what I have been able to use but I\\'d like it a lot more if I could configure it to my needs, rather than accepting the Amazon/Alexa default.Karen\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tVery satisfied with the purchase.

It controller music when I need it too. With a great sounding 360 speaker. I also bought a 4k fire TV and it can open Amazon prime video or Netflix at any moment. The included hue lighting makes this product even better. I found myself with a whole array of smart lights perfect for any house or entertainment room. The addition of phone calls on the mic and speaker makes it practical when your busy in the kitchen or on the computer. Alexa will controll it all as soon as you say \"\"Hey Alexa\"\". And if the always on mic concerns you well you can always mute the device. This is a must buy for anyone interested in ease and comfort.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"Amazon Music is great. Love the ability to create my only playlists.

I chose a Kwikset 888 because Amazon said it was compatible and I bought 2 Dots while I was at it.  And when I posed the question, somebody in the community said it will work with Alexa.  What I didn\\'t know was the Z-wave lock and Zigbee Alexa hub weren\\'t compatible.  Does any body know of a lock that works seamlessly with Echo Plus?  If not, I guess my choices are: 1. Exchange the Plus for a regular Echo and buy a separate hub like Wink.  2. Return the whole Alexa system and get something else.I  don\\'t want to just buy another hub to use along side my Echo Plus or I\\'ll be back here asking how to integrate two hubs.The reason I kept from buying smart systems up to this point  is because I was afraid they wouldn\\'t operate seamlessly and unfortunately I only do enough research after something doesn\\'t work.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tThis Echo Plus has proved to be the most innovative improvement in my life!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"I purchased the Amazon Echo Plus on Amazon prime day because I need a hub. I\\'m in the process of upgrading my home into a smart home. For the same price as some hub\\'s, and even less expensive in some other cases. I got a hub that works with my devices, plus it does a lot more. I haven\\'t even had time to go through all the skills it has, but I\\'ve already found myself using many of them. When I started a search for a hub. I wasn\\'t even considering the Echo. In part, because I didn\\'t know it was a hub. But also because I didn\\'t really think I would find much use for another AI system. If you\\'re looking for a hub. Why settle for a plane hub, when you can get a personal assistant that does so much more and yet cost\\'s the same or less than other hubs? Oh! And by the way. For the same price as the Amazon Echo Plus alone. I found one that came bundled with a smart bulb & saw another that came with a smart plug. Given the price of these extras. Well, that just put the Echo Plus over the top.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I\\'m so happy that I purchased Alexa.  When I recently saw this at a friend\\'s home, he played some music while talking about the product.  I love the sound & love that all I have to do is tell Alexa or ask a question & she responds immediately.  I haven\\'t been able to listen to my CD\\'s for a while since I have a problem within my stereo equipment for some time now so this makes me extremely happy that it\\'s not an issue any longer.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"After we learned to use this (we are still learning), we are very pleased with Echo Plus\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tI Love it !!

I AM GOING TO GET MY TECHY FRIEND TO HELP ME OUT AND I WILL UPDATE YOU LATER\\t1\\r\\n4\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I love everything about it. I love that the echo plus turns on and off my light. It can also dim them with voice commands. I also like listening to my kindle books even the ones that I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t purchased  audibles for. I like that it can play my music from Amazon music, pandora, tunein, I heart radio and Spotify. Echo can even play my local radio station. I love that the echo is connected to my TiVo Bolt. This allows TiVo to pause, stop and play whatever I want with a simple voice command. I love that I can reorder items that I purchased on Amazon and that the echo plus notifies me when my order is mailed, when it will be delivered and when the package has been delivered.  The only three dislikes that I have is that if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re up too close or to far the echo doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t respond. So I think they need to improve the microphone. And I wish the speaker was better. The speakers are okay but could be improved. Also I have the echo dot and it never has given me any problems with the internet. Well the other day I received a Red Light Right on my Echo Plus. This error was Sorry I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m having trouble understanding you please try again later. After research online I learned it was a problem connecting to my internet. And it was easy to find this out. And I found it odd that my dot wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t having this problem even though they are connected to the same network.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tLove everything about this....\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tPerfect for controlling my tp-link smart devises\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tLove this thing.

Another fun product from Amazon.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I purchased the Echo Plus with the Build-in Hub, so I could have the convenience of asking Alexa to turn my lights and lamps on and off.  Philips Hue Light Bulbs were placed in the fixtures that I wanted Alexa to control and they all work great!  I already had an Echo Dot in my Kitchen/Den area, so I placed the Echo Plus with Hub in my bedroom. My radio and lamps in my Kitchen and Den are controlled with TP-Link plugs.  But, the ceiling light fixtures and lamp in my Den and Bedroom have special Philips Hue Light Bulbs that are controlled by the Hub inside the Echo Plus.  I am able to play music, set my alarm, get weather reports and numerous other things on both devices.  The Echo Dot requires a TP-Link plug to be plugged into it and the Echo Plus requires a special Philips Light Bulbs installed in each light fixture to work..  The only thing I dislike is the high price of the light bulbs required to make the lights work. Regular light bulbs placed in the ceiling light fixtures will not work with Alexa and  the Echo Plus with Hub.  Other than the high price of the bulbs, I love my Echo Plus with built in hub!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tEasily configured hub capabilities.

I got it on Prime Day for a great deal.  I wish I had purchased two.  I also bought the Echo Show version, but the sound is not nearly as good as the Echo Plus.  The Echo Show came dented, so I will be exchanging it.  I like the screen and many of the features so I will not be getting a refund.

I purchased becausse of the sound quality, but only found out it has bluetooth capabilities last night by accident.  There needs to be a manual that details all of the functionality of the device.  Or at least point out where it can be found...\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"The Echoplus is a great extension for the Echo Dots in our home. I am a little disappointed that Alexa is not as good at information requests as Google. But as a start on home automation, she is very impressive.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tI never had ALEXA before but the biggest reason I bought it was for YOUTUBE and apparently YOUTUBE stopped supporting it and that is why it will get 4 stars.... it\\'s mostly YOUTUBE\\'s FAULT but I worked around it by using my cell phone as a blue tooth connected to hear things but still takes the voice activate purpose away but the speaker is amazing to hear my youtube watch later playlist\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tAwesome!!

Still working discovery. Really too soon to fully evaluate. But looking forward to learning and using it.\\t1\\r\\n2\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"When I got this Echo I was excited to have a device with better sound than my Dot and a hub to control some Hue bulbs.What I didn\\'t realize and also wasn\\'t fully communicated to me, is that you can\\'t use Hue bulbs to their full potential with this device. You can only turn on and off the lights and set them to a number of preset colors. You also cannot update the bulbs to the newest firmare which is a security concern for me.Do not buy this if you want a full featured hub for your new IoT devices. If you do, you will end up needing to update to a standalone hub, which makes the hub inside this device redundant and pointless.I still love the echo and have zero complaints about the Alexa functionality or sound quality of this device. I\\'m only disappointed with the hub\\'s functionalities.\"\\t0\\r\\n4\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tStill needs some work on commands. Sound is equal in the regular echo so if you don\\'t need a smart hub get a regular echo. The sound is ok with it had as much bass as my old soundlink but I mean hey gets loud on the treble and sounds clear.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"I love my echo plus. I use it with my Spotify account, to find my phone, make phone calls,  turn our lights off and on, much more. Most importantly it reads story to my children.  They love it and that makes me happy.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tExcellent why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I think it is in the beginning I love it\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"Bye bye Philips hub and expensive monthly internet charge!

Exactly as described. Only complaint I have is sometimes Alexa gets confused with smart home product names and i had to go back and change some stuff around, but i chalk that up to my inexperience with smart home stuff.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tI love it.

I tried to install two different units and neither one of them were successfully completed.  Hours with Amazon technicians.. resetting each of them.  The app didn\\'t connect the Echo Plus to the internet connection.  Tried using the application on a phone, a tablet and on a Chromebook... No luck.  There are no clean directions on the application.  Probably sending this back to Amazon..mark this as Not ready for prime time.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tWell behaved device that i enjoy using.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tEasy setup and sound quality.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tI really love the hub feature\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tWhat a blast!

It won\\'t give you much info of sport teams other than American.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I was a little apprehensive about buying this because I saw reviews saying it sounds like crap. I\\'m no audiophile by any means so maybe it\\'s that, but I think it sounds great considering the size. It fills my living room with sound and gets pretty loud while remaining clear. I haven\\'t had any issues pairing with my devices or utilizing any of the voice commands. I have it paired to an EcoBee3, my Firestick, and a Phillip\\'s Hue light bulb. I plan on adding devices as I go. I love this thing and I\\'m glad I scooped it up! I have only had it around 2 weeks. Will update if I run into issues.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tI love my Echo Plus. The only drawback is that there is no battery so it has to be plugged in at all times which makes it inconvenient  to use outdoors.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"Great device, my grandkids had a ball setting it up for me!\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t26-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tThe alexa is awesome but when i rcieved the light buld i did not know that u need another adapter to have the light buld to work.

We admit that we have not explored all that\\'s available through the Echo.  One irritating issue is that Alexa cannot answer help questions concerning how to use the system, rather it refers you to the Alexa app or help via a computer.  It was very simple to setup and use and we continue to learn how this tool can become more useful.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tI like how easy it was to set up.

Excited to learn new uses for it.\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"It was harder to setup then I thought it should be, for some reason I had to default  it twice. Had to go thru too many steps to setup and find my devices. Would be nice if it could interact with my Xfinity cable tv cable box and it also does not work with my Xfinity alarm for my house or my cameras, be nice set and disarm the alarm with Alexa. Had to install a skill app to setup bulb ??? whats that about, you ship it with your product ??? should have said (Alexa setup bulb) or (Alexa find new bulb) ??? and (Alexa setup Nest)??? it\\'s fine that you use third party apps but Alexa should do the work for you.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tNothing to dislike I love my new toy that has made my house a smart home.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tThe built in hub lacks some of the features (geo fencing) of the Phillips hub.

I am now trying to reconnect my lights.  What a pain.  I am having to reset each light bulb.  It can take up to 5 times to get it to reset.  I have spent hours on this.

The only reason I purchased this is because it works so well and I wanted it in other rooms as well. All my switches work great and I have had not issues. I the past, I did have some ghost commands when Alexa would answer a question when no one asked her to but I think some recent ipdates May have resolved this. It just keeps improving over time, not with call capabilities. I work with adapting smart homes and this is by far the cheapest, best way so far.

However this surprised me how easy it is to set up and it links to the Bluetooth in my sound bar for my TV which provides extra sound for music, I can make calls and finally hear people when home. I do not have cable, only the paid apps like Netflix and Hulu so when Alexa provided me news stations, weather and other updates it was really great to hear! I have linked all of my accounts to her, she turns on my lights before I walk through the door. She purchases re-orders off of Amazon for my pets and I heard if something bad happened at your home she would place a call to 911 regardless if she was unplugged or not.  This is important as an extra layer of protection for someone living alone.  My tech savvy bf went out and bought her after a week of me having her. Must buy!!!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t25-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"I love my Echo Plus and have cousins from Italy here visiting and they love it.

It\\'s been nothing but annoying.  The hub can\\'t be turned off if not needed and it interferes with my Hue Bridge.  I can\\'t even install Philips lights with it unless I unplug it to do so.  There are plenty of other reviews that go in depth with the issues.  Bottom line is it sucks as a hub.  It doesn\\'t support z-wave and zigbee (which in fairness I knew in advance), but when the one protocol it does support doesn\\'t do many functions that a dedicated one will, what\\'s the point?  I noticed right away that my Philips Hue Bridge supports firmware upgrades to the light bulbs themselves and this doesn\\'t.  I found that rather interesting.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t24-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t \\t1\\r\\n2\\t24-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tThe Echo does not link to Direct tv even though they said it would.

I am a disabled person, and it helps me turn light on and off, and schedule doctor appointments, using google voice phone, and get my medical rides to and from hospitals, plays music on cue from multiple web apps, and watch videos, as well as communicating to my Nurses aide my schedule and calendar of events. I wish there were programs that helped disabled people get these and smart lights. They are literally the best items since chocolate to assist the disabled and literally anybody else who need them. Although the echo show is not a hub once you set up the Echo plus hub with your lights you can use any amazon device to shut the lights off. Thank God, no more working my ass off to turn on or off lights. Thank you Amazon. I will save up enough money to buy more gift cards from Affirm.com to purchase 1 more of each and some lights for rest of the house. Jeff Bezos these are awesome items and because of your allowing me to get amazon prime at a lower cost due to disability I was finally able to buy these items on your prime day event. really helped when all you earn a month is $672 on SSDI thank you all again.\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t23-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I\\'m sure the Echo is as cool as everyone says....but I won\\'t get to try this one.

Alexa does a lot of good things for us like Alarm in the morning, verbalize books, playing music on command, even linked to my Sirrius/xm account. Good daily stuff. Good sound, but not Bose. But, the ads say &#34;Hub included&#34; so don\\'t need anything else to operate devices. Well, not so. I understand there will be some differences in product device  support. The fact that it came with the Hue light bulb works only for on /off/ dimming of the bulb. The bulb is capable of so much more with the Hue App but the Hue app does not recognize Alexa hub as a bridge. So, it appears you do have to get a Philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes, time the lights when you are away, set color tones, etc. That can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home. The list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge. Was very disappointed to find that out after the fact, to the point I feel we are being misled by Amazon by included the Hue bulbs without explanation. Maybe throw a good discount my way to get the Hue bridge if I keep the Echo Plus before I invest in more light bulbs.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t23-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t \\t1\\r\\n4\\t22-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tI love it but does not play well with my Amazon Prime... many shortcomings and potential fees\\t1\\r\\n5\\t22-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tItem as described and delivered on time.

I wanted another one for my basement. I realize it isn\\'t a huge stereo with settings but it doesn\\'t sound bad at all. Definitely doesn\\'t take up much room. Great price for the Echo Plus on Prime Day. I ordered two!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"I bought this on prime day and saved lots.I have 3 large blue tooth speakers in my house that I used for years, the echo plus was louder than all 3 combined at the same time.

The excited ended quickly.  I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus.  Everything I tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message.  I tried to set this up over and over and over again.  I watched YouTube videos.  I read set up websites.  I was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).The next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support.  I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error.  Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn\\'t work.  This product has tested my patience.  So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb.  The problem wasn\\'t the bulb, because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn\\'t locate this device.I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was shipped a defective Echo?  The support person had the same thought.  Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can\\'t get over the look of that hub.  It looks like a defuser.I can\\'t believe I didn\\'t find YouTube videos that show the problems I did.  Everything looked simple and seamless...NOT the experience I had.  OK, I\\'m done with this review because I spend enough wasted time this weekend already.\"\\t0\\r\\n4\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tGot this in a pretty good deal during the prime day event.

I expanded my Alexa usage by adding a few Echo Dots around the house and finally decided to jump and buy an Echo Plus. Let me tell you what, GREAT choice! As much as I love my original Echo, the Plus was an obvious upgrade immediately noticeable. The sound is great. And the fact that it\\'s got a built in hub for the Philips Hue lights is a huge plus!\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\treceived the wrong product...was so excited to install it ...all excitement gone. Thank you Amazon.\\t0\\r\\n4\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m having trouble with it, the alarm most of times doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work, the timer doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ends... and Alexa keeps saying she is unavailable.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tLove it just wish I could play my amazon music on both my devices without having to buy an additional subscription\\t1\\r\\n5\\t20-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tSounds a little better than the original plus it now has an interrogated Zigbee hub.  The hub is compatible with the GE Link bulbs.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I got it to try side by side with the Echo originale. They are essentially the same in dimension, weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub. As many folks already pointed out, the hub is not a direct replacement for the Philips Hue, Z wave or anything else. It provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub. For me, the voice recognition and music play capability is the same, the original Echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. The new Echo plus is priced lower than the original Echo with the built in hub but I don\\'t really need the hub with less functionality. In addition, I don\\'t think that Amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. My Philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs FW and they fixes bugs. Net net for me, this Echo does not do anything more than the original Echo and sound quality is not as good. With the  original Echo available as refurbished I would check that out first before considering this or the new Echo which is clearly inferior to both of these.\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t20-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"Why do we need to buy a $100 hub to get it to work with Samsung TV\\'s and many other devices?  I want my money back!  This thing won\\'t even turn on my TV unless I buy another hub.  What\\'s the point of having a hub that doesn\\'t support half the devices out there?  DON\\'T buy this thing unless you want to spend another $100 on another hub.  It won\\'t work with many of your devices.  Just by the Echo or Dot if you must but not this.  Better yet, get a Google device.  They actually understand you when you talk.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t20-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"I love it, in my living room\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tAbsolutely love it..  only thing that would make it better is if was rechargeable.  When playing  music with  Bluetooth speaker outside I have to go inside to change songs.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I only purchase the echo plus because it has a built in hub and came with the free philips hue bulb.  When I got everything set up, I realized the echo plus hub won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t allow full functionality of the bulb.  All it does is turn the light on/off and dim.  It will not change colors.  You still have to have a Hue Bridge to have full function of all the features of the bulb.  I wish I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo I already had since the built in hub on this echo will essentially be useless and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to buy the hue bridge to get the full benefit of the lights.\"\\t0\\r\\n2\\t20-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"At a volume setting of half or less, the speaker sounds like there is something rattling, crackling or vibrating in it.  I\\'d understand if the volume was set higher.  All speakers get distorted when over-driven.  But this doesn\\'t sound like this is an over-driven case; sounds like more of a rattle/crackle.  Possibly because the bass is too high.  Learned that there is no ability to adjust any of the sound characteristics (other than volume).  I will attempt to exchange it assuming it is just an isolated problem.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"the Sound is fantastic for the Classic  music. is like you have the orchestra at your home. and you can control the sound with out screamig at it you just have to twist the top, but also you can tell  &#34;Alexa volume 3&#34;\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"love Alexa, makes it fun when people are around and seeing it for first time\"\\t1\\r\\n3\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I was suppose to get the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfree\\xe2\\x80\\x9d lightbulb with purchase.

The mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my Sony soundbar on my TV but find the Echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. It\\'s no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. The sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. The knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. This is my first Echo device and I would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the Echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. For that alone I would recommend this over the regular Echo (2nd generation).The piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. The rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.This order came with a free Philips Hue Bulb which I installed along with an extra one I bought. I put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all I had to do was say &#34;Alexa, connect my devices&#34;. The default names for each bulb was assigned as &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34;, so I can have a dimmer floor lamp if I just turned on/off one of the lights by saying &#34;Alexa, turn off the second light&#34;. In the Alexa app, I created a \\'Group\\' with &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34; and named the group &#34;The light&#34;, so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining I just say &#34;Alexa, turn on The light&#34;.I was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the Echo Plus with its built in hub. I thought I would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. Apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! I was surprised by that. Awesome.You will feel like Tony Stark on this device. I added quite a few &#34;Skills&#34; like \\'Thunderstorm sounds\\' and \\'Quote of the day\\' . Alexa always loads them up quickly. Adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on Amazon Music is also a great feature.I can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.I was lucky to buy this for $100 on Prime Day, but I think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the Echo 2 is only $100. In my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the Echo Plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) Taller and 360 sound unit.2) Volume knob on top that you spin (I think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) Built in hub for Hue bulbs. After researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups. For me and my floor lamp, it\\'s just perfect.I highly recommend it and will buy an Echo dot for my bedroom now.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tEasy to Install. Very clear speaker.

I work in the network/technology industry for a living and have for over 20 years now, so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here. I used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up, the set up screen just continues to roll the 3 dots around the screen for about 5 minutes before the app locks up on my phone and I have to force the app to close, restart my phone and the Echo and try again.

(Not sure if that is on all models, but the Dots we have are clear.For the money, buy an echo dot or echo (2nd generation).

She is terrible at most other things. She consistently answers questions that were not asked or says &#34;hmmm I don\\'t know that&#34; for everything else. We\\'ve gone back to just using our phones because she can\\'t really look anything up. Pretty much everyone makes fun of me for spending money on this when I had an awesome Bose bluetooth already. I bought her because my mother (who lives alone) uses hers a lot and is happy with it, but we have a full house with kids and I\\'m less than impressed. I\\'d never recommend it to anyone except for senior citizens who love alone and need to be able to shout out for help in the event of a fall.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t16-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tThe setup of this device was simple and effective.  I am very pleased to see all of the additional skills and add on abilities of Alexa.  This is great for my mobility issues.

Bought the light bulbs as well and we use it daily!\\t1\\r\\n4\\t15-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tAlexa is great only she will laugh or add random comments in conversations. Last night I was asking a sibling why they are using Alexa upstairs versus the one downstairs. Then the echo dot downstairs starting singing \\xe2\\x80\\x9coh technology oh technology\\xe2\\x80\\x9d kind of weird but it seems to have a mind of its own.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t14-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"Love, Love, Love my Amazon Echo Plus!!\\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t14-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"The sound quality is not that good, especially for the price that you pay for this. I would recommend to get the Echo Dot and buy a better speaker instead. Maybe Sonos and use the Echo dot.\"\\t0\\r\\n4\\t14-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tAlexa was able to call my phone when I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find it and also turned on and off the light when commanded.  Then I came home a day later and it wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t turn on the light but would shut it off.  Then she said I had no devices; couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find my phone.  Now working again.  We will see.  Love the selection of music!\\t1\\r\\n1\\t14-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"I will be returning this piece of garbage as soon as possible. With my lifetime Amazon spending approaching nearly $40,000, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just a small customer to them, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve rarely been so disappointed out of hundreds if not thousands of Amazon purchases.I have 8+ echos for home automation and bought this Echo Plus specifically for the built-in hub along with approximately $600+ in zigbee light switches. The voice control is subpar even when it works, and that is a rarity. Most often it does nothing. I could not be more disappointed with this product and strongly discourage you from investing in the Amazon/Zigbee ecosystem. If you value your money, and expect a working product then you need to look elsewhere\"\\t0\\r\\n3\\t13-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t \\t1\\r\\n5\\t12-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I love Alexa, she works great but she not for little children.

As Alexa learns more I learn more. She\\'s my alarm clock, she reminds me of important dates. I\\'m constantly asking her for information like travel, entertainment, science, history, politics Etc.

The one challenge with the hub is that Phillips has added functionality that only works with their hub. Basic functionality works with this unit, but now I need two apps to set everything how I want it instead of one, which has caused some user issues. It\\'s woken up a couple times without the trigger word, which I find highly unsettling. We have minor issues with it not always picking up what we say correctly, but it\\'s usually just one or two repeats if that happens.The speaker is great quality and easily covers the kitchen/living room. The sleek design is not obtrusive. My girlfriend has had fun interacting with it and we\\'ve had entertaining conversations with it.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t3-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tWORKS GREAT\\t1\\r\\n5\\t2-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tVery happy\\t1\\r\\n5\\t2-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tLove this device\\t1\\r\\n5\\t2-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tI really like this item. I already had the echo dot but with this purchase the Philips Hue bulb came with the plus. Just purchasing the plus I have not had time to use it to its full capabilities but the bulb is something else. I use that with the echo dot to turn on our bedroom light and I really like it. The plus is in our great room/kitchen area. So far I give this a 5 star.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t2-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tLove it!!! Convenient. Responsive. Learns voices within the household. Best assistant so far!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t2-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"I am the Training Coordinator at my company and I have used the Amazon Blueprints skill with an Echo device and Echo Buttons to create my own Gameshow/Quiz for new hire orientation training. I\\'m always looking for new ways to engage trainees in order to make learning more enjoyable. I believe that if someone enjoys the process of learning then they\\'re much more likely to remember the information. So far, this has been a huge success with my classes and I look forward to Amazon improving and building out the Blueprints skill further!\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t1-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"This is a great tool (toy?), room-filling music, very convenient to use, just fun to have. Why only 4 stars? Supposed to work with Logitech Harmony remote: nope. Supposed to work with Denon AV receivers: nope. This may not be Amazon\\'t fault, but advertised skills should actually work. We also have the Echo Show, and the Ring skill works correctly with that device when we want to see who is at the front door.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jun-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tamazing product with amazing sound!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jun-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I love the Echo Plus mainly because I don\\'t have to worry about putting a CD, in to play.

Needed an easy to install and relatively inexpensive alternative option to fill the gap. Ordered the Amazon Fire Stick from Best Buy. Instructions were short and easy to follow. I was going to order the Amazon Ethernet Adapter because I was worried about wireless speeds in my area, but thought I\\'d wait and see. Glad I did. Wireless connection has proved almost flawless so far. A few brief hiccups here and there, but I\\'m convinced that was from the Apps themselves. Don\\'t miss the ridiculously high cable prices and am able to watch most of what I used to watch for a much lower price, which right now is a total of $50 a month. Amazon Fire Stick is limited to 1GB of memory and 8GB of storage. Thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading Apps and recording shows. So far it hasn\\'t been any issue at all. The upcoming fall tv schedule, which includes the return of NFL Football, might prove more troublesome when I need to record more often. I\\'ll worry about that then. My only real issue is that you can\\'t really turn it off. The screen remains on and uses up electricity, although probably small amounts. Luckily when you unplug it, all downloaded Apps and recorded shows stay in memory. Not sure what happens when you have something scheduled to record when it\\'s unplugged. Haven\\'t tried it yet, although I don\\'t think it\\'ll be an issue with DirectTV Now, which I\\'m using right now. So far I\\'m loving the Amazon Fire Stick. Actually love that Amazon, which I use occasionally, come pre-installed.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tConfiguration: Fire TV Stick\\tEverything\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tConfiguration: Fire TV Stick\\tLove this!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tConfiguration: Fire TV Stick\\tReally enjoying my firestick can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait to get rid of  cable such a waste of money.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tConfiguration: Fire TV Stick\\tGood\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tConfiguration: Fire TV Stick\\tLove it!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tConfiguration: Fire TV Stick\\tEasy to set up and use.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tConfiguration: Fire TV Stick\\tWooHoo! $20 on Prime Day; done!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tConfiguration: Fire TV Stick\\tPerfect\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tConfiguration: Fire TV Stick\\tVery easy to use!

Now back home, the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it\\'s little rough patch and I haven\\'t had any problems since. So, if you are having connection issues with an Echo Dot then it is probably the internet and not the device.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tSmall size works great in our sunroom.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tI like it and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I reached out to Amazon, because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use.

Definitely worth the money.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tIt plays music that I request.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI didn\\'t like that almost everytime i asked Alexa a question she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that.\\t0\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tLuv it.  It\\'s a great product.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"What can I say. Well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a  paranoid IT person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control. So yes I love my echo stuff but, I did create a isolated VLAN on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app. Be carful with these people!  Entering your Wi-Fi password on a site that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. Try to stay with devices that  work directly with the Alexa hub with no third-party app, Amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tGreat product\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Very helpful for playing music, setting alarms, and talking to you when you are lonely.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Easy to set up, can control Kasa smart plugs no problem.  Even the kids have figured stuff out that I would not have asked Alexa, like telling jokes and singing. The Alexa app controls my custom spark plug and my cloud cam.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I love having Alexa around the house. My favorite features are her timers, alarms, and music. Especially her library of sleep sounds. I got this product as a gift for my kids, and they love her too. She is great for reading time, and timing 30 minutes for it.The only thing I really don\\'t like, is that she HAS to be plugged in to an outlet to function. No ifs ands, or buts. I get why, but it is minorly inconvenient, as I have to move her from room to room, or purchase more.

I\\'m a little behind the times I\\'ve never had anything like this, another alexa or google home, so to me this is a super amazing useful tool. I use it to play sleep sounds to sleep. I use it for my amazon audible books. Set alarms, reminders, receive notifications, play games with her. Have her tell me a short story lol. It\\'s pretty fun. I know some people complained about the speaker I\\'m not sure why. I\\'m sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough. But I rent a room and in my bedroom it\\'s perfect I don\\'t have any problems with the speaker.

So awesome how it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s connects all my rooms. But like you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume.

Now I can bring Alexa out onto the patio with me, and I mostly use it for music. This is our 3rd Echo product and we love them!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tJust got my third one.

So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Lastly, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlexa\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I love this product so far only because of the few things I can do with it...such as set a timer, a reminder, play music and games. I don\\'t like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things. It was also very difficult to set up. The directions made it sound as simple as one, two, three but they forgot about step four, five and six. I was almost ready to send to back.The app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up. However depending on what you are going to be using it for I think it\\'s an ok item.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tLove the echo dot it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amaxing!!!\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I like to use it for listening to podcasts.  I like to set up the greeting in the morning to tell me what\\'s new.  The one thing I don\\'t like was getting it to recognize the radio station I wanted to listen to.  I finally got it working, but had to work through the bugs.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Just like it\\'s big sister, the Echo, only smaller, with slightly less audio fidelity, but much lower price (on amazon prime day:-)Used in another room to add Alexa to an additional room.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tIt does everything  the big guy does\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tGreat product - understands my accent!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tLove it... can\\'t stop using it..\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tReally like the availability to get instant music throughout the house.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t \\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t\"very handy in the kitchen, sets timer and gives me extra help on setting oven temps.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tCool little speaker..I love her alarms and connected it to my speakers and it sounds great!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tIt is s great tool helping with information.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tUsed twice not working!!!!!!!\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tAwesome piece of technology that has simplified my life.

Play music, answer stupid questions, finally it was able to hook up to thermostat. I can see why price is dropping like a rock.\"\\t0\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"The Echo Dot (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker is very compound in size, however it  projects very good sound. It also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker  for greater projection of sound. I also like it size because it\\'s not awkward, and it doesn\\'t take up a lot of space. It works great with the Alexa App. I also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI use the echo dot several different ways in my home. I use it downstairs to control lighting. I also take it out on my deck to stream music to a Bluetooth speaker.

Shouldn\\'t have been released into the market without proper development. Speech recognition fails to understand basic American and British Accent.The music it can play is very restrictive. Speech isn\\'t refined in a way that we understand a (almost a) human is speaking.

I can play music, set alarms, call friends, play games, set timers...the list goes on and on.  Definitely worth the money.\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tSound is terrible. Cannot pair with echo to play simultaneously.  Must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play more than one device at a time.\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tEasy installation and set up. Better sound from the Echo Dot Smart speaker. Very satisified with purchase.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t\"I am spoiled by one downstairs...so got this one for upstairs to listen to music , etc. while I walked on the treadmill.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t \\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tThe commands Alexa requires are too specific.  I find Google home to be much more flexible in figuring out what I\\'m asking for.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tHANDY AS HELL 10/10 RECOMMEND\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tI am having real difficulty working with the Echo Dot. Alexi is not very smart. 9 out of 10 questions I have asked I get the &#34;I\\'m not sure&#34;  Half the time I am still asking the question and Alexi is saying &#34;I\\'m not sure&#34;. The music is great and works well for that. All in All so far it\\'s been a very frustrating experience.\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"We are still in the discovery phase, but so far we are enjoying the smart home features we have installed.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tTotally gets out sense of humour\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tWe put one in the bedroom.  It plays music and tells us the weather.  It also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning.  It is better than a clock radio.  It will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites.  It can even tell jokes.  I don\\'t know how I got along without it before now.  Amazing.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I like the Echo, but not sure about the Dot.  I use it a lot for music and Audio books.The sound quality of this smaller Echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model.  I haven\\'t decided if I\\'ll keep it or not!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tLOVE it. I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking Alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes. We love it.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tBetter sound.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Got this for my 2nd Echo in the house, I already have the regular Echo.  The Echo Dot was easy to set up but the sound is not enjoyable, wishing I would have just gone with another regular Echo solely based on sound.\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I was really happy with my original echo so i thought I\\'d get an echo dot to use in my bedroom. I was really disappointed in the audio quality so I connected an external speaker via bluetooth. The audio was much better but I started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. Then  I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Listens well, does way more than expected, love her!\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t\"We are still testing this one out and so far, we like it. I was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first. Unfortunately, it sometimes gets our WiFi light bulbs mixed up and won\\'t turn them on but we\\'ve been able to manage and fix it. I mean, it\\'s convenient, especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the Dot. I do like that it plays music and has reminders, alarms, etc - I\\'m just still getting used to the fact that The Man is always listening now.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Works great.Having fun playing music,checking weather,a king questions.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tSmall convenient and dependable. This dot is a cutie and Alexa does the job you ask.My only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected in a such a small speaker\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tAlexa is perfect for people like me living alone. At least I have someone to talk to.. to keep my sanity. \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x82 Though I wish it has a powerful speaker and no need to connect it to bluetooth speakers.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tsmall footprint.  nice clarity.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tEasy set up\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Great addition to my Alexa base. Using it in my guest bedroom for music, clock and info.Dot speaker is not as strong as the base but it\\'s a great value\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI had an Alexia built into my thermostat that just didn\\'t work very well. I had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it. I decided to try the Echo Dot since it was on Prime Day. I have not been disappointed! It hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem. I really like that I can Bluetooth connect to my Bose Speaker for quality sound.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my Google Home mini can\\'t do.  It works well.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tthis is so much fun to play with - I just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off I tell Alexa to turn it of - Alexa learns from the questions I ask. SHe will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain. If I wake up in the middle of the night I do not have to turn on a light I just ask alexa what time is it. When I want the current weather she tells me. Ask her what going on in the city she knows. Call a friend she will dial ( I haven\\'t used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tEasy to set up and does everything it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a poster. Despite its small size the speakers are adequate. Understands instructions from across the room.

Compared to the Google Home Mini the sound is bad. Also you need Prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything. Also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both. I think it\\'s lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices.\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tIt does what it\\'s suppose to do great product.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI love this item and being able to hear any kind of music.  I enjoyed it so much that I ordered another.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tLove the dot\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tGreat item.  I\\'m so glad I made the purchase and on Prime day.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I\\'m still learning how to use it.  I figured out it can read my kindle books to me, which is a real bonus.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tLove having one in our bedroom and in the kitchen. Great to drop in on family around the house.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"So far so good.  Not to tech savvy so, I\\'m still trying to figure out what I can do with it but, it was easy to set up and so far easy to use.  Lots of apps that it can use.  I will have to play with it some more but its fun to have.\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tEcho Dot responds to us when we aren\\'t even talking to it. I\\'ve unplugged it. It feels like it\\'s &#34;spying&#34; on us.\\t0\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tNOT CONNECTED TO MY PHONE PLAYLIST :(\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I had put this off for awhile but finally got around to buying 3 of them for my home. My wife is legally blind and cannot use the computer. This has been a Godsend, 100%. We have the Amazon music for her and now she can listen to music, check the weather, get phone numbers, make calls, etc., etc.. We are still learning but I tell you, this is absolutely amazing. I purchased 4 more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on Alexa. With the wifi and direct cable capability, the speaker/stereo options are there for the choosing. This is well worth the money. You won\\'t regret this at all!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tPerfect!  Fast shipment and packaging.  Worked as intended.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tAlexa seems to get dumber and less useful all the time\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tLove it!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI\\'m addicted to this thing.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI love my Dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment. The only reason I didn\\'t give it 5 stars is because I wish the speaker would be just a little better. I know Amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but I really like to play music around the apartment when I am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized Echo. I would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. Oh well it is what it is and I still love it. I\\'m just going to have to find a Bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesn\\'t take up a whole lot of space.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tSo far all.i can say is I love it\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Love my dots.  Easy to use.  I have two plus the Echo Spot.  One of my favorite features is the ability to listen to music ... AMAZON, IHeart Radio, Pandora.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tGreat to play music throughout the house. Great and easily fits in my decor of my home\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t\"I\\'m obsessed with Alexa.

Right now, I mainly use it to play music at night, but it gets the job done.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"We love this thing! I wish I would have gotten it sooner. You will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids, but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework. There are loads of skills. I am very happy with this purchase, especially since I got it on prime day for almost half price.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tSuper easy to hook up and program. I use the music feature the most but I love how I can set reminders from my phone and my Echo will remind me at the set time.

It recognizes my voice well. It seams very intuitive. I am enjoying its ease of use.\\t1\\r\\n2\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tThe only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality.  A massive difference from the Alexa.

Otherwise it is fine.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t\"I like that she has the ability to do multiple different things like create a to do list, set and alarm, play any song I can think of and much more. I wish the sound could be a tad louder.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Too soon, I\\'m still learning what I can do with it.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tEnjoying it and still learning all the commands.

I may like a better speaker more.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t31-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tFamily loved it!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t31-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t \\t1\\r\\n4\\t31-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI like how it will connect to bluetooth without an adapter like the Google. Only reason for 4 stars is volume level without external speaker. Easy to use.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t31-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tEchos are great I have a few of them through out our home .  All in voice range to ask a question. Say a command to turn lights on or off.

Same goes when I ask to play the radio. Also, many times it get confused when I ask to switch of &#34;the lights&#34;...as other items are also named the same, which is not true. Clearly no AI or natural language, very \\'beta\\' stage still for me.

I set morning alarms, check the weather, have Alexa play various music (I bought inexpensive speakers to connect for better sound), and I\\'m learning her skills. A little tricky to connect to wifi initially, but after some trial and error it connected, and has stayed connected. So far, super satisfied. Will be buying one for my mother and one for my office.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI AM COMPLETELY IN LOVE. DOES ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING AND IS SO AMAZING AND GREAT\\t1\\r\\n2\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tNope. Still a lot to be improved. For most of the things we ask.. It says.. Hmmmm..

She works great so far.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI bought the echo dot while it was on sale for prime day and I was excited when it came in the next day. I set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine. The set up was easy and straight forward which I really appreciated because I am terrible with technology. The only reason why I am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that I can\\'t use the Echo Dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet. I am connected to both 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ wifi links and neither works. It\\'s very frustrating because I am not getting my use out of the Echo Dot and I really wish I could. If any one has had the same problems or has any solution please let me know!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI got this for dad on father\\'s Day!

SHE ROCKS!!!\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I had some trouble with my echo dot when I first got it because of internet connection issues. After doing research online I saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation Echo Dot. However, the same weekend I took a trip and brought my Echo Dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine. Now back home, the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it\\'s little rough patch and I haven\\'t had any problems since. So, if you are having connection issues with an Echo Dot then it is probably the internet and not the device.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tSmall size works great in our sunroom.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tI like it and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I reached out to Amazon, because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use.  Customer service couldn\\'t help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.  So Echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up, so its kind of pointless to have and pay for.\"\\t0\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"It won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work as a blue tooth speaker with my tv,it connects but won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I\\'ve only got to use it for a couple of weeks before having to go into the hospital, but had good time with it for the short time I did use it. It was fun trying to use Alexa\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"This was an impulse buy but turns out I really enjoy my new dot. My grands love requesting songs and playing games. I like listening to my audible selection, keeping up with my to do lists and discovering new Alexa skills. Fun and practical, my echo dot has been a surprisingly welcome addition to my home.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tGreat product at a great price.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tMy son loves his Echo Dot.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tLove these.  Great in the bathroom to listen to the news during showering.  Or listen to CNN live with Serius SM.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tI like it alot. I connected it so I can play my Pandora and I asked about the weather & time every morning. I got rid of my old fashioned digitol clock because I can have my music play Unlimited on this. I\\'m going to ask it about vacations and a few other things once I get more comfortable with it. Definitely worth the money.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tIt plays music that I request.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI didn\\'t like that almost everytime i asked Alexa a question she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that.\\t0\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tLuv it.  It\\'s a great product.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"What can I say. Well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a  paranoid IT person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control. So yes I love my echo stuff but, I did create a isolated VLAN on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app. Be carful with these people!  Entering your Wi-Fi password on a site that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. Try to stay with devices that  work directly with the Alexa hub with no third-party app, Amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tGreat product\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Very helpful for playing music, setting alarms, and talking to you when you are lonely.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Easy to set up, can control Kasa smart plugs no problem.  Even the kids have figured stuff out that I would not have asked Alexa, like telling jokes and singing. The Alexa app controls my custom spark plug and my cloud cam.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I love having Alexa around the house. My favorite features are her timers, alarms, and music. Especially her library of sleep sounds. I got this product as a gift for my kids, and they love her too. She is great for reading time, and timing 30 minutes for it.The only thing I really don\\'t like, is that she HAS to be plugged in to an outlet to function. No ifs ands, or buts. I get why, but it is minorly inconvenient, as I have to move her from room to room, or purchase more. Lol\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t\"Alarm,bed time story, universal\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI am in love with alexa\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tIts was easy to set up\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t \\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tWorks better than anticipated.

I\\'m a little behind the times I\\'ve never had anything like this, another alexa or google home, so to me this is a super amazing useful tool. I use it to play sleep sounds to sleep. I use it for my amazon audible books. Set alarms, reminders, receive notifications, play games with her. Have her tell me a short story lol. It\\'s pretty fun. I know some people complained about the speaker I\\'m not sure why. I\\'m sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough. But I rent a room and in my bedroom it\\'s perfect I don\\'t have any problems with the speaker.

So awesome how it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s connects all my rooms. But like you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume. Which I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure if I connected it to speaker or another device it would be great. But as a stand alone the volume is just ok. Definitely not like my tall echo. And the dots don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pick up voice as good as my tall echo.Still totally love them and would recommend 100%\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tits okay but keeps dropping wifi!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tKids love it!

I play continuous spa like music. Although Alexa knows the type of music needed, the device does not deliver quality sound it sounds muffled.

So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Lastly, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlexa\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I love this product so far only because of the few things I can do with it...such as set a timer, a reminder, play music and games. I don\\'t like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things. It was also very difficult to set up. The directions made it sound as simple as one, two, three but they forgot about step four, five and six. I was almost ready to send to back.The app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up. However depending on what you are going to be using it for I think it\\'s an ok item.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tLove the echo dot it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amaxing!!!\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I like to use it for listening to podcasts.

Play music, answer stupid questions, finally it was able to hook up to thermostat. I can see why price is dropping like a rock.\"\\t0\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"The Echo Dot (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker is very compound in size, however it  projects very good sound. It also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker  for greater projection of sound. I also like it size because it\\'s not awkward, and it doesn\\'t take up a lot of space. It works great with the Alexa App. I also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI use the echo dot several different ways in my home.

Shouldn\\'t have been released into the market without proper development. Speech recognition fails to understand basic American and British Accent.The music it can play is very restrictive. Speech isn\\'t refined in a way that we understand a (almost a) human is speaking.

The price I paid during Prime Day was comparable to buying a new digital clock with the bells and whistles, but this does so much more.  I can play music, set alarms, call friends, play games, set timers...the list goes on and on.  Definitely worth the money.\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tSound is terrible. Cannot pair with echo to play simultaneously.  Must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play more than one device at a time.\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tEasy installation and set up. Better sound from the Echo Dot Smart speaker. Very satisified with purchase.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t\"I am spoiled by one downstairs...so got this one for upstairs to listen to music , etc. while I walked on the treadmill.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t \\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tThe commands Alexa requires are too specific.

Alexi is not very smart. 9 out of 10 questions I have asked I get the &#34;I\\'m not sure&#34;  Half the time I am still asking the question and Alexi is saying &#34;I\\'m not sure&#34;. The music is great and works well for that. All in All so far it\\'s been a very frustrating experience.\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"We are still in the discovery phase, but so far we are enjoying the smart home features we have installed.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tTotally gets out sense of humour\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tWe put one in the bedroom.  It plays music and tells us the weather.  It also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning.  It is better than a clock radio.  It will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites.  It can even tell jokes.  I don\\'t know how I got along without it before now.  Amazing.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I like the Echo, but not sure about the Dot.  I use it a lot for music and Audio books.The sound quality of this smaller Echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model.  I haven\\'t decided if I\\'ll keep it or not!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tLOVE it. I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking Alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes. We love it.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tBetter sound.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Got this for my 2nd Echo in the house, I already have the regular Echo.  The Echo Dot was easy to set up but the sound is not enjoyable, wishing I would have just gone with another regular Echo solely based on sound.\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I was really happy with my original echo so i thought I\\'d get an echo dot to use in my bedroom. I was really disappointed in the audio quality so I connected an external speaker via bluetooth. The audio was much better but I started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. Then  I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Listens well, does way more than expected, love her!\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t\"We are still testing this one out and so far, we like it. I was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first. Unfortunately, it sometimes gets our WiFi light bulbs mixed up and won\\'t turn them on but we\\'ve been able to manage and fix it. I mean, it\\'s convenient, especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the Dot. I do like that it plays music and has reminders, alarms, etc - I\\'m just still getting used to the fact that The Man is always listening now.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Works great.Having fun playing music,checking weather,a king questions.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tSmall convenient and dependable.

I had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it. I decided to try the Echo Dot since it was on Prime Day. I have not been disappointed! It hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem. I really like that I can Bluetooth connect to my Bose Speaker for quality sound.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my Google Home mini can\\'t do.  It works well.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tthis is so much fun to play with - I just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off I tell Alexa to turn it of - Alexa learns from the questions I ask. SHe will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain. If I wake up in the middle of the night I do not have to turn on a light I just ask alexa what time is it. When I want the current weather she tells me. Ask her what going on in the city she knows. Call a friend she will dial ( I haven\\'t used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tEasy to set up and does everything it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a poster.

Compared to the Google Home Mini the sound is bad. Also you need Prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything. Also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both. I think it\\'s lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices.\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tIt does what it\\'s suppose to do great product.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI love this item and being able to hear any kind of music.

The only reason I didn\\'t give it 5 stars is because I wish the speaker would be just a little better. I know Amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but I really like to play music around the apartment when I am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized Echo. I would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. Oh well it is what it is and I still love it. I\\'m just going to have to find a Bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesn\\'t take up a whole lot of space.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tSo far all.i can say is I love it\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Love my dots.

It may be part user error or \"\"Alexa\"\" becoming accustom to what is being asked.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"these are additional alexa based devices to make access better from other parts  of our homes rather than trying to shout questions or instructions through out the house, lol. we wouldn\\'t be without alexa for the variety of functions that she performs.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t\"Works great, love the fact you can play the same music on a group of devices.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I love it, it is just what I thought it would be!!!  I\\'m addicted!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Works beautifully, excellent sound.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tStill learning everything she can do.  Good for a room.

Just what I needed!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t\"Love it! I personally prefer Spotify music, so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great that I was able to set that as default. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a day that goes by without music in our home. Also, the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave, so we tell Alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot more calmer and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bark when we lock the door and start walking away. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a must have!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tLove it.  It works great.  Alexa still has some problems  but it is getting better every day.  I\\'m not an expert but I think the sound quality is fine.  Not perfect but good.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tThis  is my second Echo to purchase -- the price was so cheap -- I\\'m seriously thinking of buying 2 more -- I use &#34;Alexa&#34; for everything -- it\\'s the next best thing to the internet  :-*\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI love it. bought one for my daughter and one for myself\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t \\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tIt is just not as loud as I thought it was going to be.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI enjoy it. Still discovering new uses.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tBeing able to add speakers is a plus. I take it on my deck when I am outside. Just love it. I have my big Alexia in my bedroom\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"excellent device , works great, having no problems or concerns\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tIt\\'s pretty fun and nice to have a speaker that responds to my questions but doesn\\'t understand my commands some of the time.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t \\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI like the hands free operation vs the Tap. We use both for controlling smart plugs.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI dislike that it confuses my requests all the time.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t \\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Love my Alexa! Actually have 3 throughout the house. Favorite function is lists.

There are times when music or talking happens randomly that may be from sensitive listening.  There should be more options to change the name of the engagement command &#34;Alexa&#34; or &#34;Computer&#34; are a little annoying.  More colors then black and white would also be a good thing.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tUse the product for music and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tEasy to set-up and to use.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tIt works great!!\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tI like having more Alexa devices in my house and the sales price on amazon prime day was too tempting.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tPHENOMENAL\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tI loved it does exactly what it says\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI used it to control my smart home devices.

There are many more task to learn. It was simple to set up.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I do love these things, i have them running my entire home, TV, all my lights, my thermostat, my front door dead bolt, the cameras... and i love listening to npr. these things are well worth the value and they really shine once you stat adding smart devices and you can control your entire home like its right out of star trek.... I named mine computer to get the feel... but its amazing what you can do with these devices and smart systems.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t\"Only complaint I have is that the sound quality isn\\'t great. I mostly use it for commands though, and I have another dot hooked up to my stereo system to play music through. I have a couple friends that have a dot and don\\'t mind the audio quality, but if you\\'re bothered by that kind of thing I\\'d go with the full size echo or make sure you hook the do up to some larger speakers.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tGood\\t1\\r\\n'}"
